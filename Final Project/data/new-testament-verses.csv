"23146","40","1","1","Matt.1.1","The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
"23147","40","1","2","Matt.1.2","Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;"
"23148","40","1","3","Matt.1.3","And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;"
"23149","40","1","4","Matt.1.4","And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;"
"23150","40","1","5","Matt.1.5","And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;"
"23151","40","1","6","Matt.1.6","And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;"
"23152","40","1","7","Matt.1.7","And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;"
"23153","40","1","8","Matt.1.8","And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;"
"23154","40","1","9","Matt.1.9","And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;"

"23156","40","1","11","Matt.1.11","And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:"
"23157","40","1","12","Matt.1.12","And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;"
"23158","40","1","13","Matt.1.13","And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;"

"23161","40","1","16","Matt.1.16","And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."
"23162","40","1","17","Matt.1.17","So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations."
"23163","40","1","18","Matt.1.18","Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost."
"23164","40","1","19","Matt.1.19","Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily."
"23165","40","1","20","Matt.1.20","But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost."
"23166","40","1","21","Matt.1.21","And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins."
"23167","40","1","22","Matt.1.22","Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,"
"23168","40","1","23","Matt.1.23","Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us."
"23169","40","1","24","Matt.1.24","Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:"
"23170","40","1","25","Matt.1.25","And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS."
"23171","40","2","1","Matt.2.1","Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,"
"23172","40","2","2","Matt.2.2","Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him."
"23173","40","2","3","Matt.2.3","When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him."
"23174","40","2","4","Matt.2.4","And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born."
"23175","40","2","5","Matt.2.5","And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,"
"23176","40","2","6","Matt.2.6","And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel."
"23177","40","2","7","Matt.2.7","Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared."
"23178","40","2","8","Matt.2.8","And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also."
"23179","40","2","9","Matt.2.9","When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was."
"23180","40","2","10","Matt.2.10","When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy."
"23181","40","2","11","Matt.2.11","And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh."
"23182","40","2","12","Matt.2.12","And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way."
"23183","40","2","13","Matt.2.13","And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
"23184","40","2","14","Matt.2.14","When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:"
"23185","40","2","15","Matt.2.15","And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son."
"23186","40","2","16","Matt.2.16","Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men."
"23187","40","2","17","Matt.2.17","Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,"
"23188","40","2","18","Matt.2.18","In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not."
"23189","40","2","19","Matt.2.19","But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,"
"23190","40","2","20","Matt.2.20","Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life."
"23191","40","2","21","Matt.2.21","And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel."
"23192","40","2","22","Matt.2.22","But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:"
"23193","40","2","23","Matt.2.23","And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene."
"23194","40","3","1","Matt.3.1","In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,"
"23195","40","3","2","Matt.3.2","And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
"23196","40","3","3","Matt.3.3","For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
"23197","40","3","4","Matt.3.4","And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey."
"23198","40","3","5","Matt.3.5","Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,"
"23199","40","3","6","Matt.3.6","And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins."
"23200","40","3","7","Matt.3.7","But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
"23201","40","3","8","Matt.3.8","Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:"
"23202","40","3","9","Matt.3.9","And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham."
"23203","40","3","10","Matt.3.10","And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
"23204","40","3","11","Matt.3.11","I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:"
"23205","40","3","12","Matt.3.12","Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
"23206","40","3","13","Matt.3.13","Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him."
"23207","40","3","14","Matt.3.14","But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?"
"23208","40","3","15","Matt.3.15","And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him."
"23209","40","3","16","Matt.3.16","And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:"
"23210","40","3","17","Matt.3.17","And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
"23211","40","4","1","Matt.4.1","Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil."
"23212","40","4","2","Matt.4.2","And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred."
"23213","40","4","3","Matt.4.3","And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread."
"23214","40","4","4","Matt.4.4","But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."
"23215","40","4","5","Matt.4.5","Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,"
"23216","40","4","6","Matt.4.6","And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone."
"23217","40","4","7","Matt.4.7","Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."
"23218","40","4","8","Matt.4.8","Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;"
"23219","40","4","9","Matt.4.9","And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me."
"23220","40","4","10","Matt.4.10","Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."
"23221","40","4","11","Matt.4.11","Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him."
"23222","40","4","12","Matt.4.12","Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;"
"23223","40","4","13","Matt.4.13","And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:"
"23224","40","4","14","Matt.4.14","That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,"
"23225","40","4","15","Matt.4.15","The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;"
"23226","40","4","16","Matt.4.16","The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up."
"23227","40","4","17","Matt.4.17","From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
"23228","40","4","18","Matt.4.18","And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers."
"23229","40","4","19","Matt.4.19","And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
"23230","40","4","20","Matt.4.20","And they straightway left their nets, and followed him."
"23231","40","4","21","Matt.4.21","And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them."
"23232","40","4","22","Matt.4.22","And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him."
"23233","40","4","23","Matt.4.23","And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people."
"23234","40","4","24","Matt.4.24","And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them."
"23235","40","4","25","Matt.4.25","And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan."
"23236","40","5","1","Matt.5.1","And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:"
"23237","40","5","2","Matt.5.2","And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,"
"23238","40","5","3","Matt.5.3","Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
"23239","40","5","4","Matt.5.4","Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted."
"23240","40","5","5","Matt.5.5","Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth."
"23241","40","5","6","Matt.5.6","Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled."
"23242","40","5","7","Matt.5.7","Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy."
"23243","40","5","8","Matt.5.8","Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God."
"23244","40","5","9","Matt.5.9","Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God."
"23245","40","5","10","Matt.5.10","Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
"23246","40","5","11","Matt.5.11","Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake."
"23247","40","5","12","Matt.5.12","Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you."
"23248","40","5","13","Matt.5.13","Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men."
"23249","40","5","14","Matt.5.14","Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid."
"23250","40","5","15","Matt.5.15","Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house."
"23251","40","5","16","Matt.5.16","Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."
"23252","40","5","17","Matt.5.17","Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."
"23253","40","5","18","Matt.5.18","For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."
"23254","40","5","19","Matt.5.19","Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
"23255","40","5","20","Matt.5.20","For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."
"23256","40","5","21","Matt.5.21","Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:"
"23257","40","5","22","Matt.5.22","But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire."
"23258","40","5","23","Matt.5.23","Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;"
"23259","40","5","24","Matt.5.24","Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift."
"23260","40","5","25","Matt.5.25","Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison."
"23261","40","5","26","Matt.5.26","Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing."
"23262","40","5","27","Matt.5.27","Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:"
"23263","40","5","28","Matt.5.28","But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."
"23264","40","5","29","Matt.5.29","And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell."
"23265","40","5","30","Matt.5.30","And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell."
"23266","40","5","31","Matt.5.31","It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:"
"23267","40","5","32","Matt.5.32","But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery."
"23268","40","5","33","Matt.5.33","Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:"
"23269","40","5","34","Matt.5.34","But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:"
"23270","40","5","35","Matt.5.35","Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King."
"23271","40","5","36","Matt.5.36","Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black."
"23272","40","5","37","Matt.5.37","But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil."
"23273","40","5","38","Matt.5.38","Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:"
"23274","40","5","39","Matt.5.39","But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."
"23275","40","5","40","Matt.5.40","And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also."
"23276","40","5","41","Matt.5.41","And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain."
"23277","40","5","42","Matt.5.42","Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away."
"23278","40","5","43","Matt.5.43","Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy."
"23279","40","5","44","Matt.5.44","But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;"
"23280","40","5","45","Matt.5.45","That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."
"23281","40","5","46","Matt.5.46","For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?"
"23282","40","5","47","Matt.5.47","And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?"
"23283","40","5","48","Matt.5.48","Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."
"23284","40","6","1","Matt.6.1","Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven."
"23285","40","6","2","Matt.6.2","Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward."
"23286","40","6","3","Matt.6.3","But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:"
"23287","40","6","4","Matt.6.4","That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly."
"23288","40","6","5","Matt.6.5","And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward."
"23289","40","6","6","Matt.6.6","But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly."
"23290","40","6","7","Matt.6.7","But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking."
"23291","40","6","8","Matt.6.8","Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him."
"23292","40","6","9","Matt.6.9","After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name."
"23293","40","6","10","Matt.6.10","Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven."
"23294","40","6","11","Matt.6.11","Give us this day our daily bread."
"23295","40","6","12","Matt.6.12","And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."
"23296","40","6","13","Matt.6.13","And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen."
"23297","40","6","14","Matt.6.14","For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:"
"23298","40","6","15","Matt.6.15","But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
"23299","40","6","16","Matt.6.16","Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward."
"23300","40","6","17","Matt.6.17","But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;"
"23301","40","6","18","Matt.6.18","That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly."
"23302","40","6","19","Matt.6.19","Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:"

"23305","40","6","22","Matt.6.22","The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light."
"23306","40","6","23","Matt.6.23","But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!"
"23307","40","6","24","Matt.6.24","No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."
"23308","40","6","25","Matt.6.25","Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?"

"23311","40","6","28","Matt.6.28","And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:"

"23322","40","7","5","Matt.7.5","Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye."
"23323","40","7","6","Matt.7.6","Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you."
"23324","40","7","7","Matt.7.7","Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:"
"23325","40","7","8","Matt.7.8","For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."
"23326","40","7","9","Matt.7.9","Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?"
"23327","40","7","10","Matt.7.10","Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?"

"23335","40","7","18","Matt.7.18","A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit."
"23336","40","7","19","Matt.7.19","Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
"23337","40","7","20","Matt.7.20","Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them."

"23341","40","7","24","Matt.7.24","Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:"
"23342","40","7","25","Matt.7.25","And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock."
"23343","40","7","26","Matt.7.26","And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:"

"23345","40","7","28","Matt.7.28","And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:"
"23346","40","7","29","Matt.7.29","For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes."
"23347","40","8","1","Matt.8.1","When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him."
"23348","40","8","2","Matt.8.2","And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean."

"23384","40","9","4","Matt.9.4","And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?"
"23385","40","9","5","Matt.9.5","For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?"
"23386","40","9","6","Matt.9.6","But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house."

"23462","40","11","2","Matt.11.2","Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,"
"23463","40","11","3","Matt.11.3","And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?"
"23464","40","11","4","Matt.11.4","Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:"
"23465","40","11","5","Matt.11.5","The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them."

"23491","40","12","1","Matt.12.1","At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat."
"23492","40","12","2","Matt.12.2","But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day."
"23493","40","12","3","Matt.12.3","But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;"

"23498","40","12","8","Matt.12.8","For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day."
"23499","40","12","9","Matt.12.9","And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:"
"23500","40","12","10","Matt.12.10","And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him."

"23545","40","13","5","Matt.13.5","Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:"
"23546","40","13","6","Matt.13.6","And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away."
"23547","40","13","7","Matt.13.7","And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:"
"23548","40","13","8","Matt.13.8","But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold."
"23549","40","13","9","Matt.13.9","Who hath ears to hear, let him hear."
"23550","40","13","10","Matt.13.10","And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?"
"23551","40","13","11","Matt.13.11","He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given."
"23552","40","13","12","Matt.13.12","For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath."
"23553","40","13","13","Matt.13.13","Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand."

"23555","40","13","15","Matt.13.15","For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."
"23556","40","13","16","Matt.13.16","But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear."

"23558","40","13","18","Matt.13.18","Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower."
"23559","40","13","19","Matt.13.19","When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side."
"23560","40","13","20","Matt.13.20","But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;"
"23561","40","13","21","Matt.13.21","Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended."
"23562","40","13","22","Matt.13.22","He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful."
"23563","40","13","23","Matt.13.23","But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty."
"23564","40","13","24","Matt.13.24","Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:"
"23565","40","13","25","Matt.13.25","But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way."
"23566","40","13","26","Matt.13.26","But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also."
"23567","40","13","27","Matt.13.27","So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?"
"23568","40","13","28","Matt.13.28","He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?"
"23569","40","13","29","Matt.13.29","But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them."
"23570","40","13","30","Matt.13.30","Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn."
"23571","40","13","31","Matt.13.31","Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:"
"23572","40","13","32","Matt.13.32","Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof."
"23573","40","13","33","Matt.13.33","Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
"23574","40","13","34","Matt.13.34","All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:"

"23576","40","13","36","Matt.13.36","Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field."
"23577","40","13","37","Matt.13.37","He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;"
"23578","40","13","38","Matt.13.38","The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;"
"23579","40","13","39","Matt.13.39","The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels."
"23580","40","13","40","Matt.13.40","As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world."
"23581","40","13","41","Matt.13.41","The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;"

"23583","40","13","43","Matt.13.43","Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear."
"23584","40","13","44","Matt.13.44","Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field."
"23585","40","13","45","Matt.13.45","Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:"
"23586","40","13","46","Matt.13.46","Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it."
"23587","40","13","47","Matt.13.47","Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:"
"23588","40","13","48","Matt.13.48","Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away."
"23589","40","13","49","Matt.13.49","So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,"

"23601","40","14","3","Matt.14.3","For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife."
"23602","40","14","4","Matt.14.4","For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her."

"23606","40","14","8","Matt.14.8","And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger."
"23607","40","14","9","Matt.14.9","And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her."

"23609","40","14","11","Matt.14.11","And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother."
"23610","40","14","12","Matt.14.12","And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus."
"23611","40","14","13","Matt.14.13","When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities."
"23612","40","14","14","Matt.14.14","And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick."
"23613","40","14","15","Matt.14.15","And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals."

"23615","40","14","17","Matt.14.17","And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes."
"23616","40","14","18","Matt.14.18","He said, Bring them hither to me."
"23617","40","14","19","Matt.14.19","And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude."
"23618","40","14","20","Matt.14.20","And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full."

"23620","40","14","22","Matt.14.22","And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away."

"23623","40","14","25","Matt.14.25","And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea."
"23624","40","14","26","Matt.14.26","And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear."
"23625","40","14","27","Matt.14.27","But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid."
"23626","40","14","28","Matt.14.28","And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water."
"23627","40","14","29","Matt.14.29","And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus."
"23628","40","14","30","Matt.14.30","But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me."
"23629","40","14","31","Matt.14.31","And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"

"23635","40","15","1","Matt.15.1","Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,"
"23636","40","15","2","Matt.15.2","Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread."
"23637","40","15","3","Matt.15.3","But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?"
"23638","40","15","4","Matt.15.4","For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death."
"23639","40","15","5","Matt.15.5","But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;"
"23640","40","15","6","Matt.15.6","And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition."
"23641","40","15","7","Matt.15.7","Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,"
"23642","40","15","8","Matt.15.8","This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me."
"23643","40","15","9","Matt.15.9","But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."
"23644","40","15","10","Matt.15.10","And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:"
"23645","40","15","11","Matt.15.11","Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man."
"23646","40","15","12","Matt.15.12","Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?"

"23658","40","15","24","Matt.15.24","But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
"23659","40","15","25","Matt.15.25","Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me."
"23660","40","15","26","Matt.15.26","But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs."
"23661","40","15","27","Matt.15.27","And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."
"23662","40","15","28","Matt.15.28","Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour."
"23663","40","15","29","Matt.15.29","And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there."
"23664","40","15","30","Matt.15.30","And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:"
"23665","40","15","31","Matt.15.31","Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel."
"23666","40","15","32","Matt.15.32","Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way."
"23667","40","15","33","Matt.15.33","And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?"
"23668","40","15","34","Matt.15.34","And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes."
"23669","40","15","35","Matt.15.35","And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground."
"23670","40","15","36","Matt.15.36","And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude."
"23671","40","15","37","Matt.15.37","And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full."
"23672","40","15","38","Matt.15.38","And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children."
"23673","40","15","39","Matt.15.39","And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala."
"23674","40","16","1","Matt.16.1","The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven."
"23675","40","16","2","Matt.16.2","He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red."
"23676","40","16","3","Matt.16.3","And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?"
"23677","40","16","4","Matt.16.4","A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed."
"23678","40","16","5","Matt.16.5","And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread."
"23679","40","16","6","Matt.16.6","Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees."
"23680","40","16","7","Matt.16.7","And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread."
"23681","40","16","8","Matt.16.8","Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?"

"23683","40","16","10","Matt.16.10","Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?"
"23684","40","16","11","Matt.16.11","How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?"
"23685","40","16","12","Matt.16.12","Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees."
"23686","40","16","13","Matt.16.13","When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?"
"23687","40","16","14","Matt.16.14","And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets."

"23689","40","16","16","Matt.16.16","And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
"23690","40","16","17","Matt.16.17","And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."
"23691","40","16","18","Matt.16.18","And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."

"23693","40","16","20","Matt.16.20","Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ."
"23694","40","16","21","Matt.16.21","From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day."
"23695","40","16","22","Matt.16.22","Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee."

"23697","40","16","24","Matt.16.24","Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."
"23698","40","16","25","Matt.16.25","For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."
"23699","40","16","26","Matt.16.26","For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"
"23700","40","16","27","Matt.16.27","For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works."
"23701","40","16","28","Matt.16.28","Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom."
"23702","40","17","1","Matt.17.1","And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,"
"23703","40","17","2","Matt.17.2","And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light."

"23705","40","17","4","Matt.17.4","Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias."
"23706","40","17","5","Matt.17.5","While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him."
"23707","40","17","6","Matt.17.6","And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid."
"23708","40","17","7","Matt.17.7","And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid."
"23709","40","17","8","Matt.17.8","And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only."
"23710","40","17","9","Matt.17.9","And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead."

"23713","40","17","12","Matt.17.12","But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them."
"23714","40","17","13","Matt.17.13","Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist."
"23715","40","17","14","Matt.17.14","And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,"
"23716","40","17","15","Matt.17.15","Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water."
"23717","40","17","16","Matt.17.16","And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him."
"23718","40","17","17","Matt.17.17","Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me."
"23719","40","17","18","Matt.17.18","And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour."
"23720","40","17","19","Matt.17.19","Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?"
"23721","40","17","20","Matt.17.20","And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you."
"23722","40","17","21","Matt.17.21","Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting."
"23723","40","17","22","Matt.17.22","And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:"
"23724","40","17","23","Matt.17.23","And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry."
"23725","40","17","24","Matt.17.24","And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?"
"23726","40","17","25","Matt.17.25","He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?"

"23729","40","18","1","Matt.18.1","At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
"23730","40","18","2","Matt.18.2","And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,"
"23731","40","18","3","Matt.18.3","And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."

"23733","40","18","5","Matt.18.5","And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me."
"23734","40","18","6","Matt.18.6","But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea."

"23754","40","18","26","Matt.18.26","The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all."
"23755","40","18","27","Matt.18.27","Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt."
"23756","40","18","28","Matt.18.28","But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest."
"23757","40","18","29","Matt.18.29","And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all."
"23758","40","18","30","Matt.18.30","And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt."
"23759","40","18","31","Matt.18.31","So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done."
"23760","40","18","32","Matt.18.32","Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:"
"23761","40","18","33","Matt.18.33","Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?"
"23762","40","18","34","Matt.18.34","And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him."
"23763","40","18","35","Matt.18.35","So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses."
"23764","40","19","1","Matt.19.1","And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;"
"23765","40","19","2","Matt.19.2","And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there."
"23766","40","19","3","Matt.19.3","The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?"
"23767","40","19","4","Matt.19.4","And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,"
"23768","40","19","5","Matt.19.5","And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?"
"23769","40","19","6","Matt.19.6","Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."
"23770","40","19","7","Matt.19.7","They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?"
"23771","40","19","8","Matt.19.8","He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so."
"23772","40","19","9","Matt.19.9","And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery."
"23773","40","19","10","Matt.19.10","His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry."
"23774","40","19","11","Matt.19.11","But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given."
"23775","40","19","12","Matt.19.12","For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it."
"23776","40","19","13","Matt.19.13","Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them."
"23777","40","19","14","Matt.19.14","But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
"23778","40","19","15","Matt.19.15","And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence."
"23779","40","19","16","Matt.19.16","And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"
"23780","40","19","17","Matt.19.17","And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments."
"23781","40","19","18","Matt.19.18","He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,"
"23782","40","19","19","Matt.19.19","Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
"23783","40","19","20","Matt.19.20","The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?"
"23784","40","19","21","Matt.19.21","Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me."
"23785","40","19","22","Matt.19.22","But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions."
"23786","40","19","23","Matt.19.23","Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven."
"23787","40","19","24","Matt.19.24","And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
"23788","40","19","25","Matt.19.25","When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?"
"23789","40","19","26","Matt.19.26","But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible."
"23790","40","19","27","Matt.19.27","Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?"
"23791","40","19","28","Matt.19.28","And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
"23792","40","19","29","Matt.19.29","And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life."
"23793","40","19","30","Matt.19.30","But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first."
"23794","40","20","1","Matt.20.1","For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard."
"23795","40","20","2","Matt.20.2","And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard."
"23796","40","20","3","Matt.20.3","And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,"
"23797","40","20","4","Matt.20.4","And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way."
"23798","40","20","5","Matt.20.5","Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise."
"23799","40","20","6","Matt.20.6","And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?"
"23800","40","20","7","Matt.20.7","They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive."
"23801","40","20","8","Matt.20.8","So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first."
"23802","40","20","9","Matt.20.9","And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny."
"23803","40","20","10","Matt.20.10","But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny."
"23804","40","20","11","Matt.20.11","And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,"
"23805","40","20","12","Matt.20.12","Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day."
"23806","40","20","13","Matt.20.13","But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?"
"23807","40","20","14","Matt.20.14","Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee."
"23808","40","20","15","Matt.20.15","Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?"
"23809","40","20","16","Matt.20.16","So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen."
"23810","40","20","17","Matt.20.17","And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,"
"23811","40","20","18","Matt.20.18","Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,"
"23812","40","20","19","Matt.20.19","And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again."
"23813","40","20","20","Matt.20.20","Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him."
"23814","40","20","21","Matt.20.21","And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom."
"23815","40","20","22","Matt.20.22","But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able."
"23816","40","20","23","Matt.20.23","And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father."
"23817","40","20","24","Matt.20.24","And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren."
"23818","40","20","25","Matt.20.25","But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them."
"23819","40","20","26","Matt.20.26","But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;"
"23820","40","20","27","Matt.20.27","And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:"
"23821","40","20","28","Matt.20.28","Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
"23822","40","20","29","Matt.20.29","And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him."
"23823","40","20","30","Matt.20.30","And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David."
"23824","40","20","31","Matt.20.31","And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David."
"23825","40","20","32","Matt.20.32","And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?"
"23826","40","20","33","Matt.20.33","They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened."
"23827","40","20","34","Matt.20.34","So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him."
"23828","40","21","1","Matt.21.1","And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,"
"23829","40","21","2","Matt.21.2","Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me."
"23830","40","21","3","Matt.21.3","And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them."
"23831","40","21","4","Matt.21.4","All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,"
"23832","40","21","5","Matt.21.5","Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass."
"23833","40","21","6","Matt.21.6","And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,"
"23834","40","21","7","Matt.21.7","And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon."
"23835","40","21","8","Matt.21.8","And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way."
"23836","40","21","9","Matt.21.9","And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest."
"23837","40","21","10","Matt.21.10","And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?"
"23838","40","21","11","Matt.21.11","And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee."
"23839","40","21","12","Matt.21.12","And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,"
"23840","40","21","13","Matt.21.13","And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves."
"23841","40","21","14","Matt.21.14","And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them."
"23842","40","21","15","Matt.21.15","And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,"
"23843","40","21","16","Matt.21.16","And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?"
"23844","40","21","17","Matt.21.17","And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there."
"23845","40","21","18","Matt.21.18","Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered."
"23846","40","21","19","Matt.21.19","And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away."
"23847","40","21","20","Matt.21.20","And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!"
"23848","40","21","21","Matt.21.21","Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done."
"23849","40","21","22","Matt.21.22","And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive."
"23850","40","21","23","Matt.21.23","And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?"
"23851","40","21","24","Matt.21.24","And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"23852","40","21","25","Matt.21.25","The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?"
"23853","40","21","26","Matt.21.26","But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet."
"23854","40","21","27","Matt.21.27","And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things."
"23855","40","21","28","Matt.21.28","But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard."
"23856","40","21","29","Matt.21.29","He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went."
"23857","40","21","30","Matt.21.30","And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not."

"23859","40","21","32","Matt.21.32","For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him."
"23860","40","21","33","Matt.21.33","Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:"
"23861","40","21","34","Matt.21.34","And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it."
"23862","40","21","35","Matt.21.35","And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another."
"23863","40","21","36","Matt.21.36","Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise."
"23864","40","21","37","Matt.21.37","But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son."
"23865","40","21","38","Matt.21.38","But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance."
"23866","40","21","39","Matt.21.39","And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him."
"23867","40","21","40","Matt.21.40","When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?"

"23873","40","21","46","Matt.21.46","But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet."
"23874","40","22","1","Matt.22.1","And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,"
"23875","40","22","2","Matt.22.2","The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,"
"23876","40","22","3","Matt.22.3","And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come."
"23877","40","22","4","Matt.22.4","Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage."
"23878","40","22","5","Matt.22.5","But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:"
"23879","40","22","6","Matt.22.6","And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them."
"23880","40","22","7","Matt.22.7","But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city."
"23881","40","22","8","Matt.22.8","Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy."
"23882","40","22","9","Matt.22.9","Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage."
"23883","40","22","10","Matt.22.10","So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests."
"23884","40","22","11","Matt.22.11","And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:"
"23885","40","22","12","Matt.22.12","And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless."
"23886","40","22","13","Matt.22.13","Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"23887","40","22","14","Matt.22.14","For many are called, but few are chosen."
"23888","40","22","15","Matt.22.15","Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk."
"23889","40","22","16","Matt.22.16","And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men."
"23890","40","22","17","Matt.22.17","Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?"

"23895","40","22","22","Matt.22.22","When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way."
"23896","40","22","23","Matt.22.23","The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,"
"23897","40","22","24","Matt.22.24","Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother."
"23898","40","22","25","Matt.22.25","Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:"

"24062","40","26","7","Matt.26.7","There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat."
"24063","40","26","8","Matt.26.8","But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?"
"24064","40","26","9","Matt.26.9","For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor."
"24065","40","26","10","Matt.26.10","When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me."
"24066","40","26","11","Matt.26.11","For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always."
"24067","40","26","12","Matt.26.12","For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial."
"24068","40","26","13","Matt.26.13","Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her."
"24069","40","26","14","Matt.26.14","Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,"
"24070","40","26","15","Matt.26.15","And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver."
"24071","40","26","16","Matt.26.16","And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him."
"24072","40","26","17","Matt.26.17","Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?"
"24073","40","26","18","Matt.26.18","And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples."
"24074","40","26","19","Matt.26.19","And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover."
"24075","40","26","20","Matt.26.20","Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve."
"24076","40","26","21","Matt.26.21","And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me."
"24077","40","26","22","Matt.26.22","And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?"
"24078","40","26","23","Matt.26.23","And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me."
"24079","40","26","24","Matt.26.24","The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born."
"24080","40","26","25","Matt.26.25","Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said."
"24081","40","26","26","Matt.26.26","And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body."
"24082","40","26","27","Matt.26.27","And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;"
"24083","40","26","28","Matt.26.28","For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins."
"24084","40","26","29","Matt.26.29","But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
"24085","40","26","30","Matt.26.30","And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives."
"24086","40","26","31","Matt.26.31","Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad."
"24087","40","26","32","Matt.26.32","But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee."
"24088","40","26","33","Matt.26.33","Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended."
"24089","40","26","34","Matt.26.34","Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice."
"24090","40","26","35","Matt.26.35","Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples."
"24091","40","26","36","Matt.26.36","Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder."
"24092","40","26","37","Matt.26.37","And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy."
"24093","40","26","38","Matt.26.38","Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me."
"24094","40","26","39","Matt.26.39","And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."
"24095","40","26","40","Matt.26.40","And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?"
"24096","40","26","41","Matt.26.41","Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
"24097","40","26","42","Matt.26.42","He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done."
"24098","40","26","43","Matt.26.43","And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy."
"24099","40","26","44","Matt.26.44","And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words."
"24100","40","26","45","Matt.26.45","Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
"24101","40","26","46","Matt.26.46","Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me."
"24102","40","26","47","Matt.26.47","And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people."
"24103","40","26","48","Matt.26.48","Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast."
"24104","40","26","49","Matt.26.49","And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him."
"24105","40","26","50","Matt.26.50","And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him."
"24106","40","26","51","Matt.26.51","And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear."
"24107","40","26","52","Matt.26.52","Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."
"24108","40","26","53","Matt.26.53","Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?"
"24109","40","26","54","Matt.26.54","But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?"
"24110","40","26","55","Matt.26.55","In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me."
"24111","40","26","56","Matt.26.56","But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled."
"24112","40","26","57","Matt.26.57","And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled."
"24113","40","26","58","Matt.26.58","But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end."
"24114","40","26","59","Matt.26.59","Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;"
"24115","40","26","60","Matt.26.60","But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,"
"24116","40","26","61","Matt.26.61","And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days."
"24117","40","26","62","Matt.26.62","And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?"
"24118","40","26","63","Matt.26.63","But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God."
"24119","40","26","64","Matt.26.64","Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."
"24120","40","26","65","Matt.26.65","Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy."
"24121","40","26","66","Matt.26.66","What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death."
"24122","40","26","67","Matt.26.67","Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,"
"24123","40","26","68","Matt.26.68","Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?"
"24124","40","26","69","Matt.26.69","Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee."
"24125","40","26","70","Matt.26.70","But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest."
"24126","40","26","71","Matt.26.71","And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth."
"24127","40","26","72","Matt.26.72","And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man."
"24128","40","26","73","Matt.26.73","And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee."
"24129","40","26","74","Matt.26.74","Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew."
"24130","40","26","75","Matt.26.75","And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly."
"24131","40","27","1","Matt.27.1","When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:"
"24132","40","27","2","Matt.27.2","And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor."
"24133","40","27","3","Matt.27.3","Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,"
"24134","40","27","4","Matt.27.4","Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that."
"24135","40","27","5","Matt.27.5","And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself."
"24136","40","27","6","Matt.27.6","And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."
"24137","40","27","7","Matt.27.7","And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in."
"24138","40","27","8","Matt.27.8","Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day."
"24139","40","27","9","Matt.27.9","Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;"
"24140","40","27","10","Matt.27.10","And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me."
"24141","40","27","11","Matt.27.11","And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest."
"24142","40","27","12","Matt.27.12","And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing."
"24143","40","27","13","Matt.27.13","Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?"
"24144","40","27","14","Matt.27.14","And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly."
"24145","40","27","15","Matt.27.15","Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would."
"24146","40","27","16","Matt.27.16","And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas."
"24147","40","27","17","Matt.27.17","Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?"
"24148","40","27","18","Matt.27.18","For he knew that for envy they had delivered him."
"24149","40","27","19","Matt.27.19","When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."
"24150","40","27","20","Matt.27.20","But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus."
"24151","40","27","21","Matt.27.21","The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas."
"24152","40","27","22","Matt.27.22","Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified."
"24153","40","27","23","Matt.27.23","And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified."
"24154","40","27","24","Matt.27.24","When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it."
"24155","40","27","25","Matt.27.25","Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children."
"24156","40","27","26","Matt.27.26","Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified."
"24157","40","27","27","Matt.27.27","Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers."
"24158","40","27","28","Matt.27.28","And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe."
"24159","40","27","29","Matt.27.29","And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!"
"24160","40","27","30","Matt.27.30","And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head."
"24161","40","27","31","Matt.27.31","And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him."
"24162","40","27","32","Matt.27.32","And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross."
"24163","40","27","33","Matt.27.33","And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,"
"24164","40","27","34","Matt.27.34","They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink."
"24165","40","27","35","Matt.27.35","And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots."
"24166","40","27","36","Matt.27.36","And sitting down they watched him there;"
"24167","40","27","37","Matt.27.37","And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
"24168","40","27","38","Matt.27.38","Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left."
"24169","40","27","39","Matt.27.39","And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,"
"24170","40","27","40","Matt.27.40","And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross."
"24171","40","27","41","Matt.27.41","Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,"
"24172","40","27","42","Matt.27.42","He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him."
"24173","40","27","43","Matt.27.43","He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God."
"24174","40","27","44","Matt.27.44","The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth."
"24175","40","27","45","Matt.27.45","Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour."
"24176","40","27","46","Matt.27.46","And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
"24177","40","27","47","Matt.27.47","Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias."
"24178","40","27","48","Matt.27.48","And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink."
"24179","40","27","49","Matt.27.49","The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him."
"24180","40","27","50","Matt.27.50","Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost."
"24181","40","27","51","Matt.27.51","And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;"
"24182","40","27","52","Matt.27.52","And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,"
"24183","40","27","53","Matt.27.53","And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many."
"24184","40","27","54","Matt.27.54","Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God."
"24185","40","27","55","Matt.27.55","And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:"
"24186","40","27","56","Matt.27.56","Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children."
"24187","40","27","57","Matt.27.57","When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:"
"24188","40","27","58","Matt.27.58","He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered."
"24189","40","27","59","Matt.27.59","And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,"
"24190","40","27","60","Matt.27.60","And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed."
"24191","40","27","61","Matt.27.61","And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre."
"24192","40","27","62","Matt.27.62","Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,"
"24193","40","27","63","Matt.27.63","Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again."
"24194","40","27","64","Matt.27.64","Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first."
"24195","40","27","65","Matt.27.65","Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can."
"24196","40","27","66","Matt.27.66","So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch."
"24197","40","28","1","Matt.28.1","In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre."
"24198","40","28","2","Matt.28.2","And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it."
"24199","40","28","3","Matt.28.3","His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:"
"24200","40","28","4","Matt.28.4","And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men."
"24201","40","28","5","Matt.28.5","And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified."
"24202","40","28","6","Matt.28.6","He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay."
"24203","40","28","7","Matt.28.7","And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you."
"24204","40","28","8","Matt.28.8","And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word."
"24205","40","28","9","Matt.28.9","And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him."
"24206","40","28","10","Matt.28.10","Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me."
"24207","40","28","11","Matt.28.11","Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done."
"24208","40","28","12","Matt.28.12","And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,"

"24250","41","1","34","Mark.1.34","And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him."
"24251","41","1","35","Mark.1.35","And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed."

"24357","41","4","33","Mark.4.33","And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it."
"24358","41","4","34","Mark.4.34","But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples."

"24360","41","4","36","Mark.4.36","And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships."
"24361","41","4","37","Mark.4.37","And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full."
"24362","41","4","38","Mark.4.38","And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?"
"24363","41","4","39","Mark.4.39","And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm."
"24364","41","4","40","Mark.4.40","And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?"
"24365","41","4","41","Mark.4.41","And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"

"24367","41","5","2","Mark.5.2","And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,"
"24368","41","5","3","Mark.5.3","Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:"
"24369","41","5","4","Mark.5.4","Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him."
"24370","41","5","5","Mark.5.5","And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones."
"24371","41","5","6","Mark.5.6","But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,"
"24372","41","5","7","Mark.5.7","And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not."
"24373","41","5","8","Mark.5.8","For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit."
"24374","41","5","9","Mark.5.9","And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many."
"24375","41","5","10","Mark.5.10","And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country."
"24376","41","5","11","Mark.5.11","Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding."
"24377","41","5","12","Mark.5.12","And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them."
"24378","41","5","13","Mark.5.13","And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea."
"24379","41","5","14","Mark.5.14","And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done."
"24380","41","5","15","Mark.5.15","And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid."
"24381","41","5","16","Mark.5.16","And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine."
"24382","41","5","17","Mark.5.17","And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts."
"24383","41","5","18","Mark.5.18","And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him."
"24384","41","5","19","Mark.5.19","Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee."
"24385","41","5","20","Mark.5.20","And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel."
"24386","41","5","21","Mark.5.21","And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea."
"24387","41","5","22","Mark.5.22","And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,"
"24388","41","5","23","Mark.5.23","And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live."
"24389","41","5","24","Mark.5.24","And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him."
"24390","41","5","25","Mark.5.25","And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,"
"24391","41","5","26","Mark.5.26","And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,"
"24392","41","5","27","Mark.5.27","When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment."
"24393","41","5","28","Mark.5.28","For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole."
"24394","41","5","29","Mark.5.29","And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague."
"24395","41","5","30","Mark.5.30","And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?"
"24396","41","5","31","Mark.5.31","And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?"
"24397","41","5","32","Mark.5.32","And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing."
"24398","41","5","33","Mark.5.33","But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth."
"24399","41","5","34","Mark.5.34","And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague."
"24400","41","5","35","Mark.5.35","While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?"
"24401","41","5","36","Mark.5.36","As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe."
"24402","41","5","37","Mark.5.37","And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James."
"24403","41","5","38","Mark.5.38","And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly."
"24404","41","5","39","Mark.5.39","And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth."
"24405","41","5","40","Mark.5.40","And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying."
"24406","41","5","41","Mark.5.41","And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise."
"24407","41","5","42","Mark.5.42","And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment."
"24408","41","5","43","Mark.5.43","And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat."
"24409","41","6","1","Mark.6.1","And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him."
"24410","41","6","2","Mark.6.2","And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?"
"24411","41","6","3","Mark.6.3","Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him."
"24412","41","6","4","Mark.6.4","But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house."
"24413","41","6","5","Mark.6.5","And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them."
"24414","41","6","6","Mark.6.6","And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching."
"24415","41","6","7","Mark.6.7","And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;"
"24416","41","6","8","Mark.6.8","And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:"
"24417","41","6","9","Mark.6.9","But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats."
"24418","41","6","10","Mark.6.10","And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place."
"24419","41","6","11","Mark.6.11","And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city."
"24420","41","6","12","Mark.6.12","And they went out, and preached that men should repent."
"24421","41","6","13","Mark.6.13","And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them."
"24422","41","6","14","Mark.6.14","And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him."
"24423","41","6","15","Mark.6.15","Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets."
"24424","41","6","16","Mark.6.16","But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead."
"24425","41","6","17","Mark.6.17","For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her."
"24426","41","6","18","Mark.6.18","For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife."
"24427","41","6","19","Mark.6.19","Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:"
"24428","41","6","20","Mark.6.20","For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly."
"24429","41","6","21","Mark.6.21","And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;"
"24430","41","6","22","Mark.6.22","And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee."
"24431","41","6","23","Mark.6.23","And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom."
"24432","41","6","24","Mark.6.24","And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist."
"24433","41","6","25","Mark.6.25","And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist."
"24434","41","6","26","Mark.6.26","And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her."
"24435","41","6","27","Mark.6.27","And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,"
"24436","41","6","28","Mark.6.28","And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother."
"24437","41","6","29","Mark.6.29","And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb."
"24438","41","6","30","Mark.6.30","And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught."
"24439","41","6","31","Mark.6.31","And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat."
"24440","41","6","32","Mark.6.32","And they departed into a desert place by ship privately."
"24441","41","6","33","Mark.6.33","And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him."
"24442","41","6","34","Mark.6.34","And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things."
"24443","41","6","35","Mark.6.35","And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:"
"24444","41","6","36","Mark.6.36","Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat."
"24445","41","6","37","Mark.6.37","He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?"
"24446","41","6","38","Mark.6.38","He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes."
"24447","41","6","39","Mark.6.39","And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass."
"24448","41","6","40","Mark.6.40","And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties."
"24449","41","6","41","Mark.6.41","And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all."
"24450","41","6","42","Mark.6.42","And they did all eat, and were filled."
"24451","41","6","43","Mark.6.43","And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes."
"24452","41","6","44","Mark.6.44","And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men."
"24453","41","6","45","Mark.6.45","And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people."
"24454","41","6","46","Mark.6.46","And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray."
"24455","41","6","47","Mark.6.47","And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land."
"24456","41","6","48","Mark.6.48","And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them."
"24457","41","6","49","Mark.6.49","But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:"
"24458","41","6","50","Mark.6.50","For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid."
"24459","41","6","51","Mark.6.51","And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered."
"24460","41","6","52","Mark.6.52","For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened."
"24461","41","6","53","Mark.6.53","And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore."
"24462","41","6","54","Mark.6.54","And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,"
"24463","41","6","55","Mark.6.55","And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was."
"24464","41","6","56","Mark.6.56","And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole."
"24465","41","7","1","Mark.7.1","Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem."
"24466","41","7","2","Mark.7.2","And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault."
"24467","41","7","3","Mark.7.3","For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders."
"24468","41","7","4","Mark.7.4","And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables."
"24469","41","7","5","Mark.7.5","Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?"
"24470","41","7","6","Mark.7.6","He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me."
"24471","41","7","7","Mark.7.7","Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."
"24472","41","7","8","Mark.7.8","For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do."
"24473","41","7","9","Mark.7.9","And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition."
"24474","41","7","10","Mark.7.10","For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:"
"24475","41","7","11","Mark.7.11","But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free."
"24476","41","7","12","Mark.7.12","And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;"
"24477","41","7","13","Mark.7.13","Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye."
"24478","41","7","14","Mark.7.14","And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:"
"24479","41","7","15","Mark.7.15","There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man."
"24480","41","7","16","Mark.7.16","If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."
"24481","41","7","17","Mark.7.17","And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable."
"24482","41","7","18","Mark.7.18","And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;"
"24483","41","7","19","Mark.7.19","Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?"
"24484","41","7","20","Mark.7.20","And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man."
"24485","41","7","21","Mark.7.21","For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,"
"24486","41","7","22","Mark.7.22","Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:"
"24487","41","7","23","Mark.7.23","All these evil things come from within, and defile the man."
"24488","41","7","24","Mark.7.24","And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid."
"24489","41","7","25","Mark.7.25","For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:"
"24490","41","7","26","Mark.7.26","The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter."
"24491","41","7","27","Mark.7.27","But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs."
"24492","41","7","28","Mark.7.28","And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs."
"24493","41","7","29","Mark.7.29","And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter."
"24494","41","7","30","Mark.7.30","And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed."
"24495","41","7","31","Mark.7.31","And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis."
"24496","41","7","32","Mark.7.32","And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him."
"24497","41","7","33","Mark.7.33","And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;"
"24498","41","7","34","Mark.7.34","And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened."
"24499","41","7","35","Mark.7.35","And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain."
"24500","41","7","36","Mark.7.36","And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;"
"24501","41","7","37","Mark.7.37","And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak."
"24502","41","8","1","Mark.8.1","In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,"
"24503","41","8","2","Mark.8.2","I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:"
"24504","41","8","3","Mark.8.3","And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far."
"24505","41","8","4","Mark.8.4","And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?"
"24506","41","8","5","Mark.8.5","And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven."
"24507","41","8","6","Mark.8.6","And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people."
"24508","41","8","7","Mark.8.7","And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them."
"24509","41","8","8","Mark.8.8","So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets."
"24510","41","8","9","Mark.8.9","And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away."
"24511","41","8","10","Mark.8.10","And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha."
"24512","41","8","11","Mark.8.11","And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him."
"24513","41","8","12","Mark.8.12","And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation."
"24514","41","8","13","Mark.8.13","And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side."
"24515","41","8","14","Mark.8.14","Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf."
"24516","41","8","15","Mark.8.15","And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod."
"24517","41","8","16","Mark.8.16","And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread."
"24518","41","8","17","Mark.8.17","And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?"
"24519","41","8","18","Mark.8.18","Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?"
"24520","41","8","19","Mark.8.19","When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve."
"24521","41","8","20","Mark.8.20","And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven."
"24522","41","8","21","Mark.8.21","And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?"
"24523","41","8","22","Mark.8.22","And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him."
"24524","41","8","23","Mark.8.23","And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought."
"24525","41","8","24","Mark.8.24","And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking."
"24526","41","8","25","Mark.8.25","After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly."
"24527","41","8","26","Mark.8.26","And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town."
"24528","41","8","27","Mark.8.27","And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?"
"24529","41","8","28","Mark.8.28","And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets."
"24530","41","8","29","Mark.8.29","And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ."

"24532","41","8","31","Mark.8.31","And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again."
"24533","41","8","32","Mark.8.32","And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him."
"24534","41","8","33","Mark.8.33","But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men."

"24551","41","9","12","Mark.9.12","And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought."
"24552","41","9","13","Mark.9.13","But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him."

"24829","41","15","2","Mark.15.2","And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it."
"24830","41","15","3","Mark.15.3","And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing."
"24831","41","15","4","Mark.15.4","And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee."
"24832","41","15","5","Mark.15.5","But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled."
"24833","41","15","6","Mark.15.6","Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired."
"24834","41","15","7","Mark.15.7","And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection."
"24835","41","15","8","Mark.15.8","And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them."
"24836","41","15","9","Mark.15.9","But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?"

"24838","41","15","11","Mark.15.11","But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them."
"24839","41","15","12","Mark.15.12","And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?"

"24907","42","1","13","Luke.1.13","But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John."
"24908","42","1","14","Luke.1.14","And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth."
"24909","42","1","15","Luke.1.15","For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb."

"24916","42","1","22","Luke.1.22","And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless."
"24917","42","1","23","Luke.1.23","And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house."
"24918","42","1","24","Luke.1.24","And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,"
"24919","42","1","25","Luke.1.25","Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men."
"24920","42","1","26","Luke.1.26","And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,"

"25143","42","5","35","Luke.5.35","But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days."
"25144","42","5","36","Luke.5.36","And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old."
"25145","42","5","37","Luke.5.37","And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish."
"25146","42","5","38","Luke.5.38","But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved."
"25147","42","5","39","Luke.5.39","No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better."
"25148","42","6","1","Luke.6.1","And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands."
"25149","42","6","2","Luke.6.2","And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?"
"25150","42","6","3","Luke.6.3","And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;"
"25151","42","6","4","Luke.6.4","How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?"
"25152","42","6","5","Luke.6.5","And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."
"25153","42","6","6","Luke.6.6","And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered."
"25154","42","6","7","Luke.6.7","And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him."
"25155","42","6","8","Luke.6.8","But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth."
"25156","42","6","9","Luke.6.9","Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?"
"25157","42","6","10","Luke.6.10","And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other."
"25158","42","6","11","Luke.6.11","And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus."
"25159","42","6","12","Luke.6.12","And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God."
"25160","42","6","13","Luke.6.13","And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;"
"25161","42","6","14","Luke.6.14","Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,"
"25162","42","6","15","Luke.6.15","Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,"
"25163","42","6","16","Luke.6.16","And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor."
"25164","42","6","17","Luke.6.17","And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;"
"25165","42","6","18","Luke.6.18","And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed."
"25166","42","6","19","Luke.6.19","And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all."
"25167","42","6","20","Luke.6.20","And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God."
"25168","42","6","21","Luke.6.21","Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh."
"25169","42","6","22","Luke.6.22","Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake."
"25170","42","6","23","Luke.6.23","Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets."
"25171","42","6","24","Luke.6.24","But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation."
"25172","42","6","25","Luke.6.25","Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep."
"25173","42","6","26","Luke.6.26","Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets."
"25174","42","6","27","Luke.6.27","But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,"
"25175","42","6","28","Luke.6.28","Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you."
"25176","42","6","29","Luke.6.29","And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also."
"25177","42","6","30","Luke.6.30","Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again."
"25178","42","6","31","Luke.6.31","And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise."
"25179","42","6","32","Luke.6.32","For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them."
"25180","42","6","33","Luke.6.33","And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same."
"25181","42","6","34","Luke.6.34","And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again."
"25182","42","6","35","Luke.6.35","But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil."
"25183","42","6","36","Luke.6.36","Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful."
"25184","42","6","37","Luke.6.37","Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:"
"25185","42","6","38","Luke.6.38","Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."
"25186","42","6","39","Luke.6.39","And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?"
"25187","42","6","40","Luke.6.40","The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master."
"25188","42","6","41","Luke.6.41","And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"
"25189","42","6","42","Luke.6.42","Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye."
"25190","42","6","43","Luke.6.43","For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit."
"25191","42","6","44","Luke.6.44","For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes."
"25192","42","6","45","Luke.6.45","A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh."
"25193","42","6","46","Luke.6.46","And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?"
"25194","42","6","47","Luke.6.47","Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:"
"25195","42","6","48","Luke.6.48","He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock."
"25196","42","6","49","Luke.6.49","But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great."
"25197","42","7","1","Luke.7.1","Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum."
"25198","42","7","2","Luke.7.2","And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die."
"25199","42","7","3","Luke.7.3","And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant."
"25200","42","7","4","Luke.7.4","And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:"
"25201","42","7","5","Luke.7.5","For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue."
"25202","42","7","6","Luke.7.6","Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:"
"25203","42","7","7","Luke.7.7","Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed."
"25204","42","7","8","Luke.7.8","For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it."
"25205","42","7","9","Luke.7.9","When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."
"25206","42","7","10","Luke.7.10","And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick."
"25207","42","7","11","Luke.7.11","And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people."
"25208","42","7","12","Luke.7.12","Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her."
"25209","42","7","13","Luke.7.13","And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not."
"25210","42","7","14","Luke.7.14","And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise."
"25211","42","7","15","Luke.7.15","And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother."
"25212","42","7","16","Luke.7.16","And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people."
"25213","42","7","17","Luke.7.17","And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about."
"25214","42","7","18","Luke.7.18","And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things."
"25215","42","7","19","Luke.7.19","And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?"
"25216","42","7","20","Luke.7.20","When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?"
"25217","42","7","21","Luke.7.21","And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight."
"25218","42","7","22","Luke.7.22","Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached."
"25219","42","7","23","Luke.7.23","And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me."
"25220","42","7","24","Luke.7.24","And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?"
"25221","42","7","25","Luke.7.25","But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts."
"25222","42","7","26","Luke.7.26","But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet."
"25223","42","7","27","Luke.7.27","This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee."
"25224","42","7","28","Luke.7.28","For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
"25225","42","7","29","Luke.7.29","And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John."
"25226","42","7","30","Luke.7.30","But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him."
"25227","42","7","31","Luke.7.31","And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?"
"25228","42","7","32","Luke.7.32","They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept."
"25229","42","7","33","Luke.7.33","For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil."
"25230","42","7","34","Luke.7.34","The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!"
"25231","42","7","35","Luke.7.35","But wisdom is justified of all her children."
"25232","42","7","36","Luke.7.36","And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat."
"25233","42","7","37","Luke.7.37","And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,"
"25234","42","7","38","Luke.7.38","And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment."
"25235","42","7","39","Luke.7.39","Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner."
"25236","42","7","40","Luke.7.40","And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on."
"25237","42","7","41","Luke.7.41","There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty."
"25238","42","7","42","Luke.7.42","And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?"
"25239","42","7","43","Luke.7.43","Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged."
"25240","42","7","44","Luke.7.44","And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head."
"25241","42","7","45","Luke.7.45","Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet."
"25242","42","7","46","Luke.7.46","My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment."
"25243","42","7","47","Luke.7.47","Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little."
"25244","42","7","48","Luke.7.48","And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven."
"25245","42","7","49","Luke.7.49","And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?"
"25246","42","7","50","Luke.7.50","And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace."
"25247","42","8","1","Luke.8.1","And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,"
"25248","42","8","2","Luke.8.2","And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,"
"25249","42","8","3","Luke.8.3","And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance."
"25250","42","8","4","Luke.8.4","And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:"
"25251","42","8","5","Luke.8.5","A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it."
"25252","42","8","6","Luke.8.6","And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture."
"25253","42","8","7","Luke.8.7","And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it."
"25254","42","8","8","Luke.8.8","And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
"25255","42","8","9","Luke.8.9","And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?"
"25256","42","8","10","Luke.8.10","And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand."
"25257","42","8","11","Luke.8.11","Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God."
"25258","42","8","12","Luke.8.12","Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved."
"25259","42","8","13","Luke.8.13","They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away."
"25260","42","8","14","Luke.8.14","And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection."
"25261","42","8","15","Luke.8.15","But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience."
"25262","42","8","16","Luke.8.16","No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light."
"25263","42","8","17","Luke.8.17","For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad."
"25264","42","8","18","Luke.8.18","Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have."
"25265","42","8","19","Luke.8.19","Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press."
"25266","42","8","20","Luke.8.20","And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee."
"25267","42","8","21","Luke.8.21","And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it."
"25268","42","8","22","Luke.8.22","Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth."
"25269","42","8","23","Luke.8.23","But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy."
"25270","42","8","24","Luke.8.24","And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm."
"25271","42","8","25","Luke.8.25","And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him."
"25272","42","8","26","Luke.8.26","And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee."
"25273","42","8","27","Luke.8.27","And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs."
"25274","42","8","28","Luke.8.28","When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not."
"25275","42","8","29","Luke.8.29","For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)"
"25276","42","8","30","Luke.8.30","And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him."
"25277","42","8","31","Luke.8.31","And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep."
"25278","42","8","32","Luke.8.32","And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them."
"25279","42","8","33","Luke.8.33","Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked."
"25280","42","8","34","Luke.8.34","When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country."
"25281","42","8","35","Luke.8.35","Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid."
"25282","42","8","36","Luke.8.36","They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed."
"25283","42","8","37","Luke.8.37","Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again."
"25284","42","8","38","Luke.8.38","Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,"
"25285","42","8","39","Luke.8.39","Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him."
"25286","42","8","40","Luke.8.40","And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him."
"25287","42","8","41","Luke.8.41","And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:"
"25288","42","8","42","Luke.8.42","For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him."
"25289","42","8","43","Luke.8.43","And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,"
"25290","42","8","44","Luke.8.44","Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched."
"25291","42","8","45","Luke.8.45","And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?"
"25292","42","8","46","Luke.8.46","And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me."
"25293","42","8","47","Luke.8.47","And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately."
"25294","42","8","48","Luke.8.48","And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace."
"25295","42","8","49","Luke.8.49","While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master."
"25296","42","8","50","Luke.8.50","But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole."
"25297","42","8","51","Luke.8.51","And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden."
"25298","42","8","52","Luke.8.52","And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth."
"25299","42","8","53","Luke.8.53","And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead."
"25300","42","8","54","Luke.8.54","And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise."
"25301","42","8","55","Luke.8.55","And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat."
"25302","42","8","56","Luke.8.56","And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done."
"25303","42","9","1","Luke.9.1","Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases."
"25304","42","9","2","Luke.9.2","And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick."
"25305","42","9","3","Luke.9.3","And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece."
"25306","42","9","4","Luke.9.4","And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart."
"25307","42","9","5","Luke.9.5","And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them."
"25308","42","9","6","Luke.9.6","And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where."
"25309","42","9","7","Luke.9.7","Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;"
"25310","42","9","8","Luke.9.8","And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again."
"25311","42","9","9","Luke.9.9","And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him."
"25312","42","9","10","Luke.9.10","And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida."
"25313","42","9","11","Luke.9.11","And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing."
"25314","42","9","12","Luke.9.12","And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place."
"25315","42","9","13","Luke.9.13","But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people."
"25316","42","9","14","Luke.9.14","For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company."
"25317","42","9","15","Luke.9.15","And they did so, and made them all sit down."
"25318","42","9","16","Luke.9.16","Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude."
"25319","42","9","17","Luke.9.17","And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets."
"25320","42","9","18","Luke.9.18","And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?"
"25321","42","9","19","Luke.9.19","They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again."
"25322","42","9","20","Luke.9.20","He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God."
"25323","42","9","21","Luke.9.21","And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;"
"25324","42","9","22","Luke.9.22","Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day."
"25325","42","9","23","Luke.9.23","And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me."
"25326","42","9","24","Luke.9.24","For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it."
"25327","42","9","25","Luke.9.25","For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?"
"25328","42","9","26","Luke.9.26","For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels."
"25329","42","9","27","Luke.9.27","But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God."
"25330","42","9","28","Luke.9.28","And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray."
"25331","42","9","29","Luke.9.29","And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering."
"25332","42","9","30","Luke.9.30","And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:"
"25333","42","9","31","Luke.9.31","Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem."
"25334","42","9","32","Luke.9.32","But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him."
"25335","42","9","33","Luke.9.33","And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said."
"25336","42","9","34","Luke.9.34","While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud."
"25337","42","9","35","Luke.9.35","And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him."
"25338","42","9","36","Luke.9.36","And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen."
"25339","42","9","37","Luke.9.37","And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him."
"25340","42","9","38","Luke.9.38","And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child."
"25341","42","9","39","Luke.9.39","And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him."
"25342","42","9","40","Luke.9.40","And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not."
"25343","42","9","41","Luke.9.41","And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither."
"25344","42","9","42","Luke.9.42","And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father."
"25345","42","9","43","Luke.9.43","And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,"
"25346","42","9","44","Luke.9.44","Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men."
"25347","42","9","45","Luke.9.45","But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying."
"25348","42","9","46","Luke.9.46","Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest."
"25349","42","9","47","Luke.9.47","And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,"
"25350","42","9","48","Luke.9.48","And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great."
"25351","42","9","49","Luke.9.49","And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us."
"25352","42","9","50","Luke.9.50","And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us."
"25353","42","9","51","Luke.9.51","And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,"
"25354","42","9","52","Luke.9.52","And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him."
"25355","42","9","53","Luke.9.53","And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem."
"25356","42","9","54","Luke.9.54","And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?"
"25357","42","9","55","Luke.9.55","But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of."
"25358","42","9","56","Luke.9.56","For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village."
"25359","42","9","57","Luke.9.57","And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest."
"25360","42","9","58","Luke.9.58","And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head."
"25361","42","9","59","Luke.9.59","And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father."
"25362","42","9","60","Luke.9.60","Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God."
"25363","42","9","61","Luke.9.61","And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house."
"25364","42","9","62","Luke.9.62","And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."
"25365","42","10","1","Luke.10.1","After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come."
"25366","42","10","2","Luke.10.2","Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest."
"25367","42","10","3","Luke.10.3","Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves."
"25368","42","10","4","Luke.10.4","Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way."
"25369","42","10","5","Luke.10.5","And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house."
"25370","42","10","6","Luke.10.6","And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again."
"25371","42","10","7","Luke.10.7","And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house."
"25372","42","10","8","Luke.10.8","And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:"
"25373","42","10","9","Luke.10.9","And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."
"25374","42","10","10","Luke.10.10","But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,"
"25375","42","10","11","Luke.10.11","Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."
"25376","42","10","12","Luke.10.12","But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city."
"25377","42","10","13","Luke.10.13","Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
"25378","42","10","14","Luke.10.14","But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you."
"25379","42","10","15","Luke.10.15","And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell."
"25380","42","10","16","Luke.10.16","He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me."
"25381","42","10","17","Luke.10.17","And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name."
"25382","42","10","18","Luke.10.18","And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven."
"25383","42","10","19","Luke.10.19","Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you."
"25384","42","10","20","Luke.10.20","Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven."
"25385","42","10","21","Luke.10.21","In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight."
"25386","42","10","22","Luke.10.22","All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him."
"25387","42","10","23","Luke.10.23","And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:"
"25388","42","10","24","Luke.10.24","For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them."
"25389","42","10","25","Luke.10.25","And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
"25390","42","10","26","Luke.10.26","He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?"
"25391","42","10","27","Luke.10.27","And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself."
"25392","42","10","28","Luke.10.28","And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live."
"25393","42","10","29","Luke.10.29","But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?"
"25394","42","10","30","Luke.10.30","And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead."
"25395","42","10","31","Luke.10.31","And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side."
"25396","42","10","32","Luke.10.32","And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side."
"25397","42","10","33","Luke.10.33","But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,"
"25398","42","10","34","Luke.10.34","And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him."
"25399","42","10","35","Luke.10.35","And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee."
"25400","42","10","36","Luke.10.36","Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?"
"25401","42","10","37","Luke.10.37","And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise."
"25402","42","10","38","Luke.10.38","Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house."
"25403","42","10","39","Luke.10.39","And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word."
"25404","42","10","40","Luke.10.40","But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me."

"25406","42","10","42","Luke.10.42","But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her."
"25407","42","11","1","Luke.11.1","And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples."
"25408","42","11","2","Luke.11.2","And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth."

"25410","42","11","4","Luke.11.4","And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil."
"25411","42","11","5","Luke.11.5","And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;"
"25412","42","11","6","Luke.11.6","For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?"
"25413","42","11","7","Luke.11.7","And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee."
"25414","42","11","8","Luke.11.8","I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth."

"25423","42","11","17","Luke.11.17","But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth."
"25424","42","11","18","Luke.11.18","If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub."

"25432","42","11","26","Luke.11.26","Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first."

"25581","42","14","27","Luke.14.27","And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple."
"25582","42","14","28","Luke.14.28","For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?"
"25583","42","14","29","Luke.14.29","Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,"
"25584","42","14","30","Luke.14.30","Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish."
"25585","42","14","31","Luke.14.31","Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?"

"25591","42","15","2","Luke.15.2","And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them."
"25592","42","15","3","Luke.15.3","And he spake this parable unto them, saying,"
"25593","42","15","4","Luke.15.4","What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?"
"25594","42","15","5","Luke.15.5","And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing."
"25595","42","15","6","Luke.15.6","And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost."
"25596","42","15","7","Luke.15.7","I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance."

"25599","42","15","10","Luke.15.10","Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth."
"25600","42","15","11","Luke.15.11","And he said, A certain man had two sons:"
"25601","42","15","12","Luke.15.12","And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living."
"25602","42","15","13","Luke.15.13","And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living."
"25603","42","15","14","Luke.15.14","And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want."
"25604","42","15","15","Luke.15.15","And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine."
"25605","42","15","16","Luke.15.16","And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him."

"25609","42","15","20","Luke.15.20","And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him."
"25610","42","15","21","Luke.15.21","And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son."
"25611","42","15","22","Luke.15.22","But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:"
"25612","42","15","23","Luke.15.23","And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:"
"25613","42","15","24","Luke.15.24","For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry."
"25614","42","15","25","Luke.15.25","Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing."
"25615","42","15","26","Luke.15.26","And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant."
"25616","42","15","27","Luke.15.27","And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound."
"25617","42","15","28","Luke.15.28","And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him."
"25618","42","15","29","Luke.15.29","And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:"
"25619","42","15","30","Luke.15.30","But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf."
"25620","42","15","31","Luke.15.31","And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine."
"25621","42","15","32","Luke.15.32","It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found."
"25622","42","16","1","Luke.16.1","And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods."
"25623","42","16","2","Luke.16.2","And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward."
"25624","42","16","3","Luke.16.3","Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed."
"25625","42","16","4","Luke.16.4","I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses."
"25626","42","16","5","Luke.16.5","So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?"
"25627","42","16","6","Luke.16.6","And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty."
"25628","42","16","7","Luke.16.7","Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore."
"25629","42","16","8","Luke.16.8","And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light."
"25630","42","16","9","Luke.16.9","And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations."

"25634","42","16","13","Luke.16.13","No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."
"25635","42","16","14","Luke.16.14","And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him."
"25636","42","16","15","Luke.16.15","And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God."
"25637","42","16","16","Luke.16.16","The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it."
"25638","42","16","17","Luke.16.17","And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."
"25639","42","16","18","Luke.16.18","Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery."
"25640","42","16","19","Luke.16.19","There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:"
"25641","42","16","20","Luke.16.20","And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,"
"25642","42","16","21","Luke.16.21","And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores."
"25643","42","16","22","Luke.16.22","And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;"
"25644","42","16","23","Luke.16.23","And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."
"25645","42","16","24","Luke.16.24","And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."
"25646","42","16","25","Luke.16.25","But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented."
"25647","42","16","26","Luke.16.26","And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence."
"25648","42","16","27","Luke.16.27","Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:"

"25650","42","16","29","Luke.16.29","Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."
"25651","42","16","30","Luke.16.30","And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent."
"25652","42","16","31","Luke.16.31","And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."
"25653","42","17","1","Luke.17.1","Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!"
"25654","42","17","2","Luke.17.2","It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones."
"25655","42","17","3","Luke.17.3","Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him."
"25656","42","17","4","Luke.17.4","And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him."
"25657","42","17","5","Luke.17.5","And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith."
"25658","42","17","6","Luke.17.6","And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you."
"25659","42","17","7","Luke.17.7","But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?"
"25660","42","17","8","Luke.17.8","And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?"

"25664","42","17","12","Luke.17.12","And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:"
"25665","42","17","13","Luke.17.13","And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us."
"25666","42","17","14","Luke.17.14","And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed."
"25667","42","17","15","Luke.17.15","And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,"
"25668","42","17","16","Luke.17.16","And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan."
"25669","42","17","17","Luke.17.17","And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?"
"25670","42","17","18","Luke.17.18","There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger."

"25672","42","17","20","Luke.17.20","And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:"
"25673","42","17","21","Luke.17.21","Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you."
"25674","42","17","22","Luke.17.22","And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it."
"25675","42","17","23","Luke.17.23","And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them."
"25676","42","17","24","Luke.17.24","For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day."
"25677","42","17","25","Luke.17.25","But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation."
"25678","42","17","26","Luke.17.26","And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man."
"25679","42","17","27","Luke.17.27","They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all."
"25680","42","17","28","Luke.17.28","Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;"

"25690","42","18","1","Luke.18.1","And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;"
"25691","42","18","2","Luke.18.2","Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:"
"25692","42","18","3","Luke.18.3","And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary."
"25693","42","18","4","Luke.18.4","And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;"

"25697","42","18","8","Luke.18.8","I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?"
"25698","42","18","9","Luke.18.9","And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:"
"25699","42","18","10","Luke.18.10","Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican."
"25700","42","18","11","Luke.18.11","The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican."
"25701","42","18","12","Luke.18.12","I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess."
"25702","42","18","13","Luke.18.13","And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner."
"25703","42","18","14","Luke.18.14","I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
"25704","42","18","15","Luke.18.15","And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them."
"25705","42","18","16","Luke.18.16","But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God."
"25706","42","18","17","Luke.18.17","Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein."

"25709","42","18","20","Luke.18.20","Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother."
"25710","42","18","21","Luke.18.21","And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up."
"25711","42","18","22","Luke.18.22","Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me."

"25714","42","18","25","Luke.18.25","For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
"25715","42","18","26","Luke.18.26","And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?"

"25730","42","18","41","Luke.18.41","Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight."
"25731","42","18","42","Luke.18.42","And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee."
"25732","42","18","43","Luke.18.43","And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God."
"25733","42","19","1","Luke.19.1","And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho."
"25734","42","19","2","Luke.19.2","And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich."
"25735","42","19","3","Luke.19.3","And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature."
"25736","42","19","4","Luke.19.4","And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way."
"25737","42","19","5","Luke.19.5","And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house."
"25738","42","19","6","Luke.19.6","And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully."
"25739","42","19","7","Luke.19.7","And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner."
"25740","42","19","8","Luke.19.8","And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold."
"25741","42","19","9","Luke.19.9","And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham."
"25742","42","19","10","Luke.19.10","For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost."
"25743","42","19","11","Luke.19.11","And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear."
"25744","42","19","12","Luke.19.12","He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return."
"25745","42","19","13","Luke.19.13","And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come."
"25746","42","19","14","Luke.19.14","But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us."
"25747","42","19","15","Luke.19.15","And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading."
"25748","42","19","16","Luke.19.16","Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds."
"25749","42","19","17","Luke.19.17","And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities."
"25750","42","19","18","Luke.19.18","And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds."
"25751","42","19","19","Luke.19.19","And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities."
"25752","42","19","20","Luke.19.20","And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:"
"25753","42","19","21","Luke.19.21","For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow."
"25754","42","19","22","Luke.19.22","And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:"
"25755","42","19","23","Luke.19.23","Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?"
"25756","42","19","24","Luke.19.24","And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds."
"25757","42","19","25","Luke.19.25","And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)"
"25758","42","19","26","Luke.19.26","For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him."
"25759","42","19","27","Luke.19.27","But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me."
"25760","42","19","28","Luke.19.28","And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem."
"25761","42","19","29","Luke.19.29","And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,"
"25762","42","19","30","Luke.19.30","Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither."
"25763","42","19","31","Luke.19.31","And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him."
"25764","42","19","32","Luke.19.32","And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them."
"25765","42","19","33","Luke.19.33","And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?"
"25766","42","19","34","Luke.19.34","And they said, The Lord hath need of him."
"25767","42","19","35","Luke.19.35","And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon."
"25768","42","19","36","Luke.19.36","And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way."
"25769","42","19","37","Luke.19.37","And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;"
"25770","42","19","38","Luke.19.38","Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest."
"25771","42","19","39","Luke.19.39","And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples."
"25772","42","19","40","Luke.19.40","And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out."
"25773","42","19","41","Luke.19.41","And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,"
"25774","42","19","42","Luke.19.42","Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes."
"25775","42","19","43","Luke.19.43","For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,"
"25776","42","19","44","Luke.19.44","And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation."
"25777","42","19","45","Luke.19.45","And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;"
"25778","42","19","46","Luke.19.46","Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves."
"25779","42","19","47","Luke.19.47","And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,"
"25780","42","19","48","Luke.19.48","And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him."
"25781","42","20","1","Luke.20.1","And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,"
"25782","42","20","2","Luke.20.2","And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?"
"25783","42","20","3","Luke.20.3","And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:"
"25784","42","20","4","Luke.20.4","The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?"
"25785","42","20","5","Luke.20.5","And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?"
"25786","42","20","6","Luke.20.6","But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet."
"25787","42","20","7","Luke.20.7","And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was."
"25788","42","20","8","Luke.20.8","And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things."
"25789","42","20","9","Luke.20.9","Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time."
"25790","42","20","10","Luke.20.10","And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty."
"25791","42","20","11","Luke.20.11","And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty."
"25792","42","20","12","Luke.20.12","And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out."
"25793","42","20","13","Luke.20.13","Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him."
"25794","42","20","14","Luke.20.14","But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours."
"25795","42","20","15","Luke.20.15","So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?"
"25796","42","20","16","Luke.20.16","He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid."
"25797","42","20","17","Luke.20.17","And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?"
"25798","42","20","18","Luke.20.18","Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."
"25799","42","20","19","Luke.20.19","And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them."
"25800","42","20","20","Luke.20.20","And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor."
"25801","42","20","21","Luke.20.21","And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:"
"25802","42","20","22","Luke.20.22","Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?"
"25803","42","20","23","Luke.20.23","But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?"
"25804","42","20","24","Luke.20.24","Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's."
"25805","42","20","25","Luke.20.25","And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's."
"25806","42","20","26","Luke.20.26","And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace."
"25807","42","20","27","Luke.20.27","Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,"
"25808","42","20","28","Luke.20.28","Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother."
"25809","42","20","29","Luke.20.29","There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children."
"25810","42","20","30","Luke.20.30","And the second took her to wife, and he died childless."
"25811","42","20","31","Luke.20.31","And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died."
"25812","42","20","32","Luke.20.32","Last of all the woman died also."
"25813","42","20","33","Luke.20.33","Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife."
"25814","42","20","34","Luke.20.34","And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:"
"25815","42","20","35","Luke.20.35","But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:"
"25816","42","20","36","Luke.20.36","Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection."
"25817","42","20","37","Luke.20.37","Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."
"25818","42","20","38","Luke.20.38","For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him."
"25819","42","20","39","Luke.20.39","Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said."
"25820","42","20","40","Luke.20.40","And after that they durst not ask him any question at all."
"25821","42","20","41","Luke.20.41","And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?"
"25822","42","20","42","Luke.20.42","And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,"
"25823","42","20","43","Luke.20.43","Till I make thine enemies thy footstool."
"25824","42","20","44","Luke.20.44","David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?"
"25825","42","20","45","Luke.20.45","Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,"
"25826","42","20","46","Luke.20.46","Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;"
"25827","42","20","47","Luke.20.47","Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation."
"25828","42","21","1","Luke.21.1","And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury."
"25829","42","21","2","Luke.21.2","And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites."
"25830","42","21","3","Luke.21.3","And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:"
"25831","42","21","4","Luke.21.4","For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had."
"25832","42","21","5","Luke.21.5","And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,"
"25833","42","21","6","Luke.21.6","As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
"25834","42","21","7","Luke.21.7","And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?"
"25835","42","21","8","Luke.21.8","And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them."
"25836","42","21","9","Luke.21.9","But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by."
"25837","42","21","10","Luke.21.10","Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:"
"25838","42","21","11","Luke.21.11","And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven."
"25839","42","21","12","Luke.21.12","But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake."
"25840","42","21","13","Luke.21.13","And it shall turn to you for a testimony."
"25841","42","21","14","Luke.21.14","Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:"
"25842","42","21","15","Luke.21.15","For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist."
"25843","42","21","16","Luke.21.16","And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death."
"25844","42","21","17","Luke.21.17","And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake."
"25845","42","21","18","Luke.21.18","But there shall not an hair of your head perish."
"25846","42","21","19","Luke.21.19","In your patience possess ye your souls."
"25847","42","21","20","Luke.21.20","And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh."
"25848","42","21","21","Luke.21.21","Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto."
"25849","42","21","22","Luke.21.22","For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled."
"25850","42","21","23","Luke.21.23","But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people."

"25855","42","21","28","Luke.21.28","And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh."
"25856","42","21","29","Luke.21.29","And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;"
"25857","42","21","30","Luke.21.30","When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand."
"25858","42","21","31","Luke.21.31","So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand."

"25863","42","21","36","Luke.21.36","Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man."
"25864","42","21","37","Luke.21.37","And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives."

"25889","42","22","24","Luke.22.24","And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest."
"25890","42","22","25","Luke.22.25","And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors."
"25891","42","22","26","Luke.22.26","But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve."
"25892","42","22","27","Luke.22.27","For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth."
"25893","42","22","28","Luke.22.28","Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations."
"25894","42","22","29","Luke.22.29","And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;"

"25898","42","22","33","Luke.22.33","And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death."
"25899","42","22","34","Luke.22.34","And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me."

"25907","42","22","42","Luke.22.42","Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done."
"25908","42","22","43","Luke.22.43","And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him."
"25909","42","22","44","Luke.22.44","And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground."
"25910","42","22","45","Luke.22.45","And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,"
"25911","42","22","46","Luke.22.46","And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation."

"25940","42","23","4","Luke.23.4","Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man."
"25941","42","23","5","Luke.23.5","And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place."

"25950","42","23","14","Luke.23.14","Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:"
"25951","42","23","15","Luke.23.15","No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him."
"25952","42","23","16","Luke.23.16","I will therefore chastise him, and release him."
"25953","42","23","17","Luke.23.17","For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)"
"25954","42","23","18","Luke.23.18","And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:"

"25956","42","23","20","Luke.23.20","Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them."
"25957","42","23","21","Luke.23.21","But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him."
"25958","42","23","22","Luke.23.22","And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go."
"25959","42","23","23","Luke.23.23","And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed."
"25960","42","23","24","Luke.23.24","And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required."
"25961","42","23","25","Luke.23.25","And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will."
"25962","42","23","26","Luke.23.26","And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus."
"25963","42","23","27","Luke.23.27","And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him."
"25964","42","23","28","Luke.23.28","But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children."
"25965","42","23","29","Luke.23.29","For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck."

"25970","42","23","34","Luke.23.34","Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots."
"25971","42","23","35","Luke.23.35","And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God."
"25972","42","23","36","Luke.23.36","And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,"
"25973","42","23","37","Luke.23.37","And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself."
"25974","42","23","38","Luke.23.38","And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."

"25977","42","23","41","Luke.23.41","And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss."
"25978","42","23","42","Luke.23.42","And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom."
"25979","42","23","43","Luke.23.43","And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise."
"25980","42","23","44","Luke.23.44","And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour."

"25985","42","23","49","Luke.23.49","And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things."
"25986","42","23","50","Luke.23.50","And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:"
"25987","42","23","51","Luke.23.51","The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God."
"25988","42","23","52","Luke.23.52","This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus."
"25989","42","23","53","Luke.23.53","And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid."
"25990","42","23","54","Luke.23.54","And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on."
"25991","42","23","55","Luke.23.55","And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid."
"25992","42","23","56","Luke.23.56","And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment."
"25993","42","24","1","Luke.24.1","Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them."
"25994","42","24","2","Luke.24.2","And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre."
"25995","42","24","3","Luke.24.3","And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus."
"25996","42","24","4","Luke.24.4","And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:"

"26001","42","24","9","Luke.24.9","And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest."
"26002","42","24","10","Luke.24.10","It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles."
"26003","42","24","11","Luke.24.11","And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not."
"26004","42","24","12","Luke.24.12","Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass."

"26045","42","24","53","Luke.24.53","And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen."
"26046","43","1","1","John.1.1","In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
"26047","43","1","2","John.1.2","The same was in the beginning with God."
"26048","43","1","3","John.1.3","All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made."
"26049","43","1","4","John.1.4","In him was life; and the life was the light of men."
"26050","43","1","5","John.1.5","And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not."
"26051","43","1","6","John.1.6","There was a man sent from God, whose name was John."
"26052","43","1","7","John.1.7","The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe."
"26053","43","1","8","John.1.8","He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light."
"26054","43","1","9","John.1.9","That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world."
"26055","43","1","10","John.1.10","He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not."
"26056","43","1","11","John.1.11","He came unto his own, and his own received him not."
"26057","43","1","12","John.1.12","But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:"
"26058","43","1","13","John.1.13","Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."
"26059","43","1","14","John.1.14","And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."
"26060","43","1","15","John.1.15","John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me."
"26061","43","1","16","John.1.16","And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace."
"26062","43","1","17","John.1.17","For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."
"26063","43","1","18","John.1.18","No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him."
"26064","43","1","19","John.1.19","And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?"
"26065","43","1","20","John.1.20","And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ."
"26066","43","1","21","John.1.21","And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No."
"26067","43","1","22","John.1.22","Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?"
"26068","43","1","23","John.1.23","He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias."
"26069","43","1","24","John.1.24","And they which were sent were of the Pharisees."
"26070","43","1","25","John.1.25","And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?"
"26071","43","1","26","John.1.26","John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;"
"26072","43","1","27","John.1.27","He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose."
"26073","43","1","28","John.1.28","These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing."
"26074","43","1","29","John.1.29","The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world."
"26075","43","1","30","John.1.30","This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me."
"26076","43","1","31","John.1.31","And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water."
"26077","43","1","32","John.1.32","And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him."
"26078","43","1","33","John.1.33","And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."
"26079","43","1","34","John.1.34","And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God."
"26080","43","1","35","John.1.35","Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;"
"26081","43","1","36","John.1.36","And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!"
"26082","43","1","37","John.1.37","And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus."
"26083","43","1","38","John.1.38","Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?"
"26084","43","1","39","John.1.39","He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour."
"26085","43","1","40","John.1.40","One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother."
"26086","43","1","41","John.1.41","He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ."
"26087","43","1","42","John.1.42","And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone."
"26088","43","1","43","John.1.43","The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me."
"26089","43","1","44","John.1.44","Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."
"26090","43","1","45","John.1.45","Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
"26091","43","1","46","John.1.46","And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see."
"26092","43","1","47","John.1.47","Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"
"26093","43","1","48","John.1.48","Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee."
"26094","43","1","49","John.1.49","Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel."
"26095","43","1","50","John.1.50","Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these."
"26096","43","1","51","John.1.51","And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."
"26097","43","2","1","John.2.1","And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:"
"26098","43","2","2","John.2.2","And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage."
"26099","43","2","3","John.2.3","And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine."
"26100","43","2","4","John.2.4","Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come."
"26101","43","2","5","John.2.5","His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it."
"26102","43","2","6","John.2.6","And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece."
"26103","43","2","7","John.2.7","Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim."
"26104","43","2","8","John.2.8","And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it."
"26105","43","2","9","John.2.9","When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,"
"26106","43","2","10","John.2.10","And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now."
"26107","43","2","11","John.2.11","This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him."
"26108","43","2","12","John.2.12","After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days."
"26109","43","2","13","John.2.13","And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,"
"26110","43","2","14","John.2.14","And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:"
"26111","43","2","15","John.2.15","And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;"
"26112","43","2","16","John.2.16","And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise."
"26113","43","2","17","John.2.17","And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up."
"26114","43","2","18","John.2.18","Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?"
"26115","43","2","19","John.2.19","Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
"26116","43","2","20","John.2.20","Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?"
"26117","43","2","21","John.2.21","But he spake of the temple of his body."
"26118","43","2","22","John.2.22","When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said."
"26119","43","2","23","John.2.23","Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did."
"26120","43","2","24","John.2.24","But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,"
"26121","43","2","25","John.2.25","And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man."
"26122","43","3","1","John.3.1","There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:"
"26123","43","3","2","John.3.2","The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him."
"26124","43","3","3","John.3.3","Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
"26125","43","3","4","John.3.4","Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"
"26126","43","3","5","John.3.5","Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
"26127","43","3","6","John.3.6","That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
"26128","43","3","7","John.3.7","Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again."
"26129","43","3","8","John.3.8","The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit."
"26130","43","3","9","John.3.9","Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?"
"26131","43","3","10","John.3.10","Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?"
"26132","43","3","11","John.3.11","Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness."
"26133","43","3","12","John.3.12","If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?"
"26134","43","3","13","John.3.13","And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven."
"26135","43","3","14","John.3.14","And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:"
"26136","43","3","15","John.3.15","That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life."
"26137","43","3","16","John.3.16","For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
"26138","43","3","17","John.3.17","For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved."
"26139","43","3","18","John.3.18","He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."
"26140","43","3","19","John.3.19","And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."
"26141","43","3","20","John.3.20","For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved."
"26142","43","3","21","John.3.21","But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God."
"26143","43","3","22","John.3.22","After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized."
"26144","43","3","23","John.3.23","And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized."
"26145","43","3","24","John.3.24","For John was not yet cast into prison."
"26146","43","3","25","John.3.25","Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying."
"26147","43","3","26","John.3.26","And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him."
"26148","43","3","27","John.3.27","John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven."
"26149","43","3","28","John.3.28","Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him."
"26150","43","3","29","John.3.29","He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled."
"26151","43","3","30","John.3.30","He must increase, but I must decrease."
"26152","43","3","31","John.3.31","He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all."
"26153","43","3","32","John.3.32","And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony."
"26154","43","3","33","John.3.33","He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true."
"26155","43","3","34","John.3.34","For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him."
"26156","43","3","35","John.3.35","The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand."
"26157","43","3","36","John.3.36","He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him."
"26158","43","4","1","John.4.1","When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,"
"26159","43","4","2","John.4.2","Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)"
"26160","43","4","3","John.4.3","He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee."
"26161","43","4","4","John.4.4","And he must needs go through Samaria."
"26162","43","4","5","John.4.5","Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph."
"26163","43","4","6","John.4.6","Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour."
"26164","43","4","7","John.4.7","There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink."
"26165","43","4","8","John.4.8","For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)"
"26166","43","4","9","John.4.9","Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans."
"26167","43","4","10","John.4.10","Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water."
"26168","43","4","11","John.4.11","The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?"
"26169","43","4","12","John.4.12","Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?"
"26170","43","4","13","John.4.13","Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:"
"26171","43","4","14","John.4.14","But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life."
"26172","43","4","15","John.4.15","The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw."
"26173","43","4","16","John.4.16","Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither."
"26174","43","4","17","John.4.17","The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:"
"26175","43","4","18","John.4.18","For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly."
"26176","43","4","19","John.4.19","The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet."
"26177","43","4","20","John.4.20","Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship."
"26178","43","4","21","John.4.21","Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father."
"26179","43","4","22","John.4.22","Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews."
"26180","43","4","23","John.4.23","But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him."
"26181","43","4","24","John.4.24","God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."
"26182","43","4","25","John.4.25","The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things."
"26183","43","4","26","John.4.26","Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he."
"26184","43","4","27","John.4.27","And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?"
"26185","43","4","28","John.4.28","The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,"
"26186","43","4","29","John.4.29","Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?"
"26187","43","4","30","John.4.30","Then they went out of the city, and came unto him."
"26188","43","4","31","John.4.31","In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat."
"26189","43","4","32","John.4.32","But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of."
"26190","43","4","33","John.4.33","Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?"
"26191","43","4","34","John.4.34","Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work."
"26192","43","4","35","John.4.35","Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest."
"26193","43","4","36","John.4.36","And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together."
"26194","43","4","37","John.4.37","And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth."
"26195","43","4","38","John.4.38","I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours."
"26196","43","4","39","John.4.39","And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did."
"26197","43","4","40","John.4.40","So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days."
"26198","43","4","41","John.4.41","And many more believed because of his own word;"
"26199","43","4","42","John.4.42","And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world."
"26200","43","4","43","John.4.43","Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee."
"26201","43","4","44","John.4.44","For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country."
"26202","43","4","45","John.4.45","Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast."
"26203","43","4","46","John.4.46","So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum."
"26204","43","4","47","John.4.47","When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death."
"26205","43","4","48","John.4.48","Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe."
"26206","43","4","49","John.4.49","The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die."
"26207","43","4","50","John.4.50","Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way."
"26208","43","4","51","John.4.51","And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth."
"26209","43","4","52","John.4.52","Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."
"26210","43","4","53","John.4.53","So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house."
"26211","43","4","54","John.4.54","This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee."
"26212","43","5","1","John.5.1","After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
"26213","43","5","2","John.5.2","Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches."
"26214","43","5","3","John.5.3","In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water."
"26215","43","5","4","John.5.4","For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had."
"26216","43","5","5","John.5.5","And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years."
"26217","43","5","6","John.5.6","When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?"
"26218","43","5","7","John.5.7","The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me."
"26219","43","5","8","John.5.8","Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk."
"26220","43","5","9","John.5.9","And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath."
"26221","43","5","10","John.5.10","The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed."
"26222","43","5","11","John.5.11","He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk."
"26223","43","5","12","John.5.12","Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?"
"26224","43","5","13","John.5.13","And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place."
"26225","43","5","14","John.5.14","Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee."
"26226","43","5","15","John.5.15","The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole."
"26227","43","5","16","John.5.16","And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day."
"26228","43","5","17","John.5.17","But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work."
"26229","43","5","18","John.5.18","Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God."
"26230","43","5","19","John.5.19","Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise."
"26231","43","5","20","John.5.20","For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel."
"26232","43","5","21","John.5.21","For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will."
"26233","43","5","22","John.5.22","For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:"
"26234","43","5","23","John.5.23","That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him."
"26235","43","5","24","John.5.24","Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life."
"26236","43","5","25","John.5.25","Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live."
"26237","43","5","26","John.5.26","For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;"
"26238","43","5","27","John.5.27","And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man."
"26239","43","5","28","John.5.28","Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,"
"26240","43","5","29","John.5.29","And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."
"26241","43","5","30","John.5.30","I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me."
"26242","43","5","31","John.5.31","If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true."
"26243","43","5","32","John.5.32","There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true."
"26244","43","5","33","John.5.33","Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth."
"26245","43","5","34","John.5.34","But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved."
"26246","43","5","35","John.5.35","He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light."
"26247","43","5","36","John.5.36","But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me."
"26248","43","5","37","John.5.37","And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape."
"26249","43","5","38","John.5.38","And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not."
"26250","43","5","39","John.5.39","Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me."
"26251","43","5","40","John.5.40","And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life."
"26252","43","5","41","John.5.41","I receive not honour from men."
"26253","43","5","42","John.5.42","But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you."
"26254","43","5","43","John.5.43","I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive."
"26255","43","5","44","John.5.44","How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?"
"26256","43","5","45","John.5.45","Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust."
"26257","43","5","46","John.5.46","For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me."
"26258","43","5","47","John.5.47","But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?"
"26259","43","6","1","John.6.1","After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias."
"26260","43","6","2","John.6.2","And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased."
"26261","43","6","3","John.6.3","And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples."
"26262","43","6","4","John.6.4","And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh."
"26263","43","6","5","John.6.5","When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?"
"26264","43","6","6","John.6.6","And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do."
"26265","43","6","7","John.6.7","Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little."
"26266","43","6","8","John.6.8","One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,"
"26267","43","6","9","John.6.9","There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?"
"26268","43","6","10","John.6.10","And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand."
"26269","43","6","11","John.6.11","And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would."
"26270","43","6","12","John.6.12","When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost."
"26271","43","6","13","John.6.13","Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten."
"26272","43","6","14","John.6.14","Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world."
"26273","43","6","15","John.6.15","When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone."
"26274","43","6","16","John.6.16","And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,"
"26275","43","6","17","John.6.17","And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them."
"26276","43","6","18","John.6.18","And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew."
"26277","43","6","19","John.6.19","So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid."
"26278","43","6","20","John.6.20","But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid."
"26279","43","6","21","John.6.21","Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went."
"26280","43","6","22","John.6.22","The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;"
"26281","43","6","23","John.6.23","Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)"
"26282","43","6","24","John.6.24","When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus."
"26283","43","6","25","John.6.25","And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?"
"26284","43","6","26","John.6.26","Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled."
"26285","43","6","27","John.6.27","Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed."
"26286","43","6","28","John.6.28","Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?"
"26287","43","6","29","John.6.29","Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent."
"26288","43","6","30","John.6.30","They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?"
"26289","43","6","31","John.6.31","Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat."
"26290","43","6","32","John.6.32","Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven."
"26291","43","6","33","John.6.33","For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world."
"26292","43","6","34","John.6.34","Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread."
"26293","43","6","35","John.6.35","And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst."
"26294","43","6","36","John.6.36","But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not."
"26295","43","6","37","John.6.37","All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out."
"26296","43","6","38","John.6.38","For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me."
"26297","43","6","39","John.6.39","And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day."
"26298","43","6","40","John.6.40","And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day."
"26299","43","6","41","John.6.41","The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven."
"26300","43","6","42","John.6.42","And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?"
"26301","43","6","43","John.6.43","Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves."
"26302","43","6","44","John.6.44","No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day."
"26303","43","6","45","John.6.45","It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me."
"26304","43","6","46","John.6.46","Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father."
"26305","43","6","47","John.6.47","Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life."
"26306","43","6","48","John.6.48","I am that bread of life."
"26307","43","6","49","John.6.49","Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead."
"26308","43","6","50","John.6.50","This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die."
"26309","43","6","51","John.6.51","I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."
"26310","43","6","52","John.6.52","The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
"26311","43","6","53","John.6.53","Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you."
"26312","43","6","54","John.6.54","Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."
"26313","43","6","55","John.6.55","For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed."
"26314","43","6","56","John.6.56","He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him."
"26315","43","6","57","John.6.57","As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me."
"26316","43","6","58","John.6.58","This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever."
"26317","43","6","59","John.6.59","These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum."
"26318","43","6","60","John.6.60","Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?"
"26319","43","6","61","John.6.61","When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?"
"26320","43","6","62","John.6.62","What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?"
"26321","43","6","63","John.6.63","It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life."
"26322","43","6","64","John.6.64","But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him."
"26323","43","6","65","John.6.65","And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father."
"26324","43","6","66","John.6.66","From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him."
"26325","43","6","67","John.6.67","Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?"
"26326","43","6","68","John.6.68","Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life."
"26327","43","6","69","John.6.69","And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God."
"26328","43","6","70","John.6.70","Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
"26329","43","6","71","John.6.71","He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve."
"26330","43","7","1","John.7.1","After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him."
"26331","43","7","2","John.7.2","Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand."
"26332","43","7","3","John.7.3","His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest."
"26333","43","7","4","John.7.4","For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world."
"26334","43","7","5","John.7.5","For neither did his brethren believe in him."
"26335","43","7","6","John.7.6","Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready."
"26336","43","7","7","John.7.7","The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil."
"26337","43","7","8","John.7.8","Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come."
"26338","43","7","9","John.7.9","When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee."
"26339","43","7","10","John.7.10","But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret."
"26340","43","7","11","John.7.11","Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?"
"26341","43","7","12","John.7.12","And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people."
"26342","43","7","13","John.7.13","Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews."
"26343","43","7","14","John.7.14","Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught."
"26344","43","7","15","John.7.15","And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?"
"26345","43","7","16","John.7.16","Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me."
"26346","43","7","17","John.7.17","If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself."
"26347","43","7","18","John.7.18","He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him."
"26348","43","7","19","John.7.19","Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?"
"26349","43","7","20","John.7.20","The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?"
"26350","43","7","21","John.7.21","Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel."
"26351","43","7","22","John.7.22","Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man."
"26352","43","7","23","John.7.23","If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?"
"26353","43","7","24","John.7.24","Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment."
"26354","43","7","25","John.7.25","Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?"
"26355","43","7","26","John.7.26","But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?"
"26356","43","7","27","John.7.27","Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is."
"26357","43","7","28","John.7.28","Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not."
"26358","43","7","29","John.7.29","But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me."
"26359","43","7","30","John.7.30","Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come."
"26360","43","7","31","John.7.31","And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?"
"26361","43","7","32","John.7.32","The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him."
"26362","43","7","33","John.7.33","Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me."
"26363","43","7","34","John.7.34","Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come."
"26364","43","7","35","John.7.35","Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?"
"26365","43","7","36","John.7.36","What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?"
"26366","43","7","37","John.7.37","In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink."
"26367","43","7","38","John.7.38","He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."
"26368","43","7","39","John.7.39","But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)"
"26369","43","7","40","John.7.40","Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet."
"26370","43","7","41","John.7.41","Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?"
"26371","43","7","42","John.7.42","Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?"
"26372","43","7","43","John.7.43","So there was a division among the people because of him."
"26373","43","7","44","John.7.44","And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him."
"26374","43","7","45","John.7.45","Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?"
"26375","43","7","46","John.7.46","The officers answered, Never man spake like this man."
"26376","43","7","47","John.7.47","Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?"
"26377","43","7","48","John.7.48","Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?"
"26378","43","7","49","John.7.49","But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed."
"26379","43","7","50","John.7.50","Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)"
"26380","43","7","51","John.7.51","Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?"
"26381","43","7","52","John.7.52","They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet."
"26382","43","7","53","John.7.53","And every man went unto his own house."
"26383","43","8","1","John.8.1","Jesus went unto the mount of Olives."
"26384","43","8","2","John.8.2","And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them."
"26385","43","8","3","John.8.3","And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,"
"26386","43","8","4","John.8.4","They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act."
"26387","43","8","5","John.8.5","Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?"
"26388","43","8","6","John.8.6","This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not."
"26389","43","8","7","John.8.7","So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."
"26390","43","8","8","John.8.8","And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground."
"26391","43","8","9","John.8.9","And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst."
"26392","43","8","10","John.8.10","When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?"
"26393","43","8","11","John.8.11","She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."
"26394","43","8","12","John.8.12","Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
"26395","43","8","13","John.8.13","The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true."
"26396","43","8","14","John.8.14","Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go."
"26397","43","8","15","John.8.15","Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man."
"26398","43","8","16","John.8.16","And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me."
"26399","43","8","17","John.8.17","It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true."
"26400","43","8","18","John.8.18","I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me."
"26401","43","8","19","John.8.19","Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also."
"26402","43","8","20","John.8.20","These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come."
"26403","43","8","21","John.8.21","Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come."
"26404","43","8","22","John.8.22","Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come."
"26405","43","8","23","John.8.23","And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world."
"26406","43","8","24","John.8.24","I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins."
"26407","43","8","25","John.8.25","Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning."
"26408","43","8","26","John.8.26","I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him."
"26409","43","8","27","John.8.27","They understood not that he spake to them of the Father."
"26410","43","8","28","John.8.28","Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things."
"26411","43","8","29","John.8.29","And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him."
"26412","43","8","30","John.8.30","As he spake these words, many believed on him."
"26413","43","8","31","John.8.31","Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;"
"26414","43","8","32","John.8.32","And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
"26415","43","8","33","John.8.33","They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?"
"26416","43","8","34","John.8.34","Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin."
"26417","43","8","35","John.8.35","And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever."
"26418","43","8","36","John.8.36","If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."
"26419","43","8","37","John.8.37","I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you."
"26420","43","8","38","John.8.38","I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father."
"26421","43","8","39","John.8.39","They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham."
"26422","43","8","40","John.8.40","But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham."
"26423","43","8","41","John.8.41","Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God."
"26424","43","8","42","John.8.42","Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me."
"26425","43","8","43","John.8.43","Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word."
"26426","43","8","44","John.8.44","Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it."
"26427","43","8","45","John.8.45","And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not."
"26428","43","8","46","John.8.46","Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?"
"26429","43","8","47","John.8.47","He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God."
"26430","43","8","48","John.8.48","Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?"
"26431","43","8","49","John.8.49","Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me."
"26432","43","8","50","John.8.50","And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth."
"26433","43","8","51","John.8.51","Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death."
"26434","43","8","52","John.8.52","Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death."
"26435","43","8","53","John.8.53","Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?"
"26436","43","8","54","John.8.54","Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:"
"26437","43","8","55","John.8.55","Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying."
"26438","43","8","56","John.8.56","Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad."
"26439","43","8","57","John.8.57","Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?"
"26440","43","8","58","John.8.58","Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am."
"26441","43","8","59","John.8.59","Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by."
"26442","43","9","1","John.9.1","And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth."
"26443","43","9","2","John.9.2","And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?"
"26444","43","9","3","John.9.3","Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him."
"26445","43","9","4","John.9.4","I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work."
"26446","43","9","5","John.9.5","As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
"26447","43","9","6","John.9.6","When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,"
"26448","43","9","7","John.9.7","And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing."
"26449","43","9","8","John.9.8","The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?"
"26450","43","9","9","John.9.9","Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he."
"26451","43","9","10","John.9.10","Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?"
"26452","43","9","11","John.9.11","He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight."
"26453","43","9","12","John.9.12","Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not."
"26454","43","9","13","John.9.13","They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind."
"26455","43","9","14","John.9.14","And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes."
"26456","43","9","15","John.9.15","Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see."
"26457","43","9","16","John.9.16","Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them."
"26458","43","9","17","John.9.17","They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet."
"26459","43","9","18","John.9.18","But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight."
"26460","43","9","19","John.9.19","And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?"
"26461","43","9","20","John.9.20","His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:"
"26462","43","9","21","John.9.21","But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself."
"26463","43","9","22","John.9.22","These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue."
"26464","43","9","23","John.9.23","Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him."
"26465","43","9","24","John.9.24","Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner."
"26466","43","9","25","John.9.25","He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see."
"26467","43","9","26","John.9.26","Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?"
"26468","43","9","27","John.9.27","He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?"
"26469","43","9","28","John.9.28","Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples."
"26470","43","9","29","John.9.29","We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is."
"26471","43","9","30","John.9.30","The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes."
"26472","43","9","31","John.9.31","Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth."
"26473","43","9","32","John.9.32","Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind."
"26474","43","9","33","John.9.33","If this man were not of God, he could do nothing."
"26475","43","9","34","John.9.34","They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out."
"26476","43","9","35","John.9.35","Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?"
"26477","43","9","36","John.9.36","He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?"
"26478","43","9","37","John.9.37","And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee."
"26479","43","9","38","John.9.38","And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him."
"26480","43","9","39","John.9.39","And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind."
"26481","43","9","40","John.9.40","And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?"
"26482","43","9","41","John.9.41","Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth."
"26483","43","10","1","John.10.1","Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber."
"26484","43","10","2","John.10.2","But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep."
"26485","43","10","3","John.10.3","To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out."
"26486","43","10","4","John.10.4","And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice."
"26487","43","10","5","John.10.5","And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers."
"26488","43","10","6","John.10.6","This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them."
"26489","43","10","7","John.10.7","Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep."
"26490","43","10","8","John.10.8","All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them."
"26491","43","10","9","John.10.9","I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture."
"26492","43","10","10","John.10.10","The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly."
"26493","43","10","11","John.10.11","I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep."
"26494","43","10","12","John.10.12","But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep."
"26495","43","10","13","John.10.13","The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep."
"26496","43","10","14","John.10.14","I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine."
"26497","43","10","15","John.10.15","As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep."
"26498","43","10","16","John.10.16","And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd."
"26499","43","10","17","John.10.17","Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again."
"26500","43","10","18","John.10.18","No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father."
"26501","43","10","19","John.10.19","There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings."
"26502","43","10","20","John.10.20","And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?"
"26503","43","10","21","John.10.21","Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?"
"26504","43","10","22","John.10.22","And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter."
"26505","43","10","23","John.10.23","And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch."
"26506","43","10","24","John.10.24","Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly."
"26507","43","10","25","John.10.25","Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me."
"26508","43","10","26","John.10.26","But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you."
"26509","43","10","27","John.10.27","My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:"
"26510","43","10","28","John.10.28","And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand."
"26511","43","10","29","John.10.29","My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand."
"26512","43","10","30","John.10.30","I and my Father are one."
"26513","43","10","31","John.10.31","Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him."
"26514","43","10","32","John.10.32","Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?"
"26515","43","10","33","John.10.33","The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God."
"26516","43","10","34","John.10.34","Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?"
"26517","43","10","35","John.10.35","If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;"
"26518","43","10","36","John.10.36","Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?"
"26519","43","10","37","John.10.37","If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not."
"26520","43","10","38","John.10.38","But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him."
"26521","43","10","39","John.10.39","Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,"
"26522","43","10","40","John.10.40","And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode."
"26523","43","10","41","John.10.41","And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true."
"26524","43","10","42","John.10.42","And many believed on him there."
"26525","43","11","1","John.11.1","Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha."
"26526","43","11","2","John.11.2","It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)"
"26527","43","11","3","John.11.3","Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick."
"26528","43","11","4","John.11.4","When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby."
"26529","43","11","5","John.11.5","Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus."
"26530","43","11","6","John.11.6","When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was."
"26531","43","11","7","John.11.7","Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again."
"26532","43","11","8","John.11.8","His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?"
"26533","43","11","9","John.11.9","Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world."
"26534","43","11","10","John.11.10","But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him."
"26535","43","11","11","John.11.11","These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep."
"26536","43","11","12","John.11.12","Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well."
"26537","43","11","13","John.11.13","Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep."
"26538","43","11","14","John.11.14","Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead."
"26539","43","11","15","John.11.15","And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him."
"26540","43","11","16","John.11.16","Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him."
"26541","43","11","17","John.11.17","Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already."
"26542","43","11","18","John.11.18","Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:"
"26543","43","11","19","John.11.19","And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother."
"26544","43","11","20","John.11.20","Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house."
"26545","43","11","21","John.11.21","Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died."
"26546","43","11","22","John.11.22","But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee."
"26547","43","11","23","John.11.23","Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again."
"26548","43","11","24","John.11.24","Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
"26549","43","11","25","John.11.25","Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:"
"26550","43","11","26","John.11.26","And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?"
"26551","43","11","27","John.11.27","She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world."
"26552","43","11","28","John.11.28","And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee."
"26553","43","11","29","John.11.29","As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him."
"26554","43","11","30","John.11.30","Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him."
"26555","43","11","31","John.11.31","The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there."
"26556","43","11","32","John.11.32","Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died."
"26557","43","11","33","John.11.33","When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,"
"26558","43","11","34","John.11.34","And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see."
"26559","43","11","35","John.11.35","Jesus wept."
"26560","43","11","36","John.11.36","Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!"
"26561","43","11","37","John.11.37","And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"
"26562","43","11","38","John.11.38","Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it."
"26563","43","11","39","John.11.39","Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days."
"26564","43","11","40","John.11.40","Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?"
"26565","43","11","41","John.11.41","Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me."
"26566","43","11","42","John.11.42","And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me."
"26567","43","11","43","John.11.43","And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth."
"26568","43","11","44","John.11.44","And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go."
"26569","43","11","45","John.11.45","Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him."
"26570","43","11","46","John.11.46","But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done."
"26571","43","11","47","John.11.47","Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles."
"26572","43","11","48","John.11.48","If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation."
"26573","43","11","49","John.11.49","And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,"
"26574","43","11","50","John.11.50","Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not."
"26575","43","11","51","John.11.51","And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;"
"26576","43","11","52","John.11.52","And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad."
"26577","43","11","53","John.11.53","Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death."
"26578","43","11","54","John.11.54","Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples."
"26579","43","11","55","John.11.55","And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves."
"26580","43","11","56","John.11.56","Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?"
"26581","43","11","57","John.11.57","Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him."
"26582","43","12","1","John.12.1","Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead."
"26583","43","12","2","John.12.2","There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him."
"26584","43","12","3","John.12.3","Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment."
"26585","43","12","4","John.12.4","Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,"
"26586","43","12","5","John.12.5","Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?"
"26587","43","12","6","John.12.6","This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein."
"26588","43","12","7","John.12.7","Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this."
"26589","43","12","8","John.12.8","For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always."
"26590","43","12","9","John.12.9","Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead."
"26591","43","12","10","John.12.10","But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;"
"26592","43","12","11","John.12.11","Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus."
"26593","43","12","12","John.12.12","On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,"
"26594","43","12","13","John.12.13","Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord."
"26595","43","12","14","John.12.14","And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,"
"26596","43","12","15","John.12.15","Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt."
"26597","43","12","16","John.12.16","These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him."
"26598","43","12","17","John.12.17","The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record."
"26599","43","12","18","John.12.18","For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle."
"26600","43","12","19","John.12.19","The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him."
"26601","43","12","20","John.12.20","And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:"
"26602","43","12","21","John.12.21","The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus."
"26603","43","12","22","John.12.22","Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus."
"26604","43","12","23","John.12.23","And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified."
"26605","43","12","24","John.12.24","Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."
"26606","43","12","25","John.12.25","He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal."
"26607","43","12","26","John.12.26","If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour."
"26608","43","12","27","John.12.27","Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour."
"26609","43","12","28","John.12.28","Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."
"26610","43","12","29","John.12.29","The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him."
"26611","43","12","30","John.12.30","Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes."
"26612","43","12","31","John.12.31","Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out."
"26613","43","12","32","John.12.32","And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me."
"26614","43","12","33","John.12.33","This he said, signifying what death he should die."
"26615","43","12","34","John.12.34","The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?"
"26616","43","12","35","John.12.35","Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth."
"26617","43","12","36","John.12.36","While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them."
"26618","43","12","37","John.12.37","But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:"
"26619","43","12","38","John.12.38","That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
"26620","43","12","39","John.12.39","Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,"
"26621","43","12","40","John.12.40","He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them."
"26622","43","12","41","John.12.41","These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him."
"26623","43","12","42","John.12.42","Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:"
"26624","43","12","43","John.12.43","For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God."
"26625","43","12","44","John.12.44","Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me."
"26626","43","12","45","John.12.45","And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me."
"26627","43","12","46","John.12.46","I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness."
"26628","43","12","47","John.12.47","And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."
"26629","43","12","48","John.12.48","He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."
"26630","43","12","49","John.12.49","For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak."
"26631","43","12","50","John.12.50","And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak."
"26632","43","13","1","John.13.1","Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end."
"26633","43","13","2","John.13.2","And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;"
"26634","43","13","3","John.13.3","Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;"
"26635","43","13","4","John.13.4","He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself."
"26636","43","13","5","John.13.5","After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded."
"26637","43","13","6","John.13.6","Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?"
"26638","43","13","7","John.13.7","Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter."
"26639","43","13","8","John.13.8","Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me."
"26640","43","13","9","John.13.9","Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head."
"26641","43","13","10","John.13.10","Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all."
"26642","43","13","11","John.13.11","For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean."
"26643","43","13","12","John.13.12","So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?"
"26644","43","13","13","John.13.13","Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am."
"26645","43","13","14","John.13.14","If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet."
"26646","43","13","15","John.13.15","For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you."
"26647","43","13","16","John.13.16","Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him."
"26648","43","13","17","John.13.17","If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them."
"26649","43","13","18","John.13.18","I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me."
"26650","43","13","19","John.13.19","Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he."
"26651","43","13","20","John.13.20","Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me."
"26652","43","13","21","John.13.21","When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me."
"26653","43","13","22","John.13.22","Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake."
"26654","43","13","23","John.13.23","Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved."
"26655","43","13","24","John.13.24","Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake."
"26656","43","13","25","John.13.25","He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?"
"26657","43","13","26","John.13.26","Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon."
"26658","43","13","27","John.13.27","And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly."
"26659","43","13","28","John.13.28","Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him."
"26660","43","13","29","John.13.29","For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor."
"26661","43","13","30","John.13.30","He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night."
"26662","43","13","31","John.13.31","Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him."
"26663","43","13","32","John.13.32","If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him."
"26664","43","13","33","John.13.33","Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you."
"26665","43","13","34","John.13.34","A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another."
"26666","43","13","35","John.13.35","By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another."
"26667","43","13","36","John.13.36","Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards."
"26668","43","13","37","John.13.37","Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake."
"26669","43","13","38","John.13.38","Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice."
"26670","43","14","1","John.14.1","Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me."
"26671","43","14","2","John.14.2","In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you."
"26672","43","14","3","John.14.3","And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also."
"26673","43","14","4","John.14.4","And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know."
"26674","43","14","5","John.14.5","Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?"
"26675","43","14","6","John.14.6","Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."
"26676","43","14","7","John.14.7","If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him."
"26677","43","14","8","John.14.8","Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us."
"26678","43","14","9","John.14.9","Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?"
"26679","43","14","10","John.14.10","Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works."
"26680","43","14","11","John.14.11","Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake."
"26681","43","14","12","John.14.12","Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father."
"26682","43","14","13","John.14.13","And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
"26683","43","14","14","John.14.14","If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it."

"26767","43","17","7","John.17.7","Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee."
"26768","43","17","8","John.17.8","For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me."
"26769","43","17","9","John.17.9","I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine."

"26787","43","18","1","John.18.1","When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples."
"26788","43","18","2","John.18.2","And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples."
"26789","43","18","3","John.18.3","Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons."
"26790","43","18","4","John.18.4","Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?"

"26793","43","18","7","John.18.7","Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth."
"26794","43","18","8","John.18.8","Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:"

"26796","43","18","10","John.18.10","Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus."
"26797","43","18","11","John.18.11","Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?"

"26799","43","18","13","John.18.13","And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year."
"26800","43","18","14","John.18.14","Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people."
"26801","43","18","15","John.18.15","And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest."
"26802","43","18","16","John.18.16","But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter."
"26803","43","18","17","John.18.17","Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not."
"26804","43","18","18","John.18.18","And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself."
"26805","43","18","19","John.18.19","The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine."
"26806","43","18","20","John.18.20","Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing."
"26807","43","18","21","John.18.21","Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said."
"26808","43","18","22","John.18.22","And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?"
"26809","43","18","23","John.18.23","Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?"
"26810","43","18","24","John.18.24","Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest."
"26811","43","18","25","John.18.25","And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not."
"26812","43","18","26","John.18.26","One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?"
"26813","43","18","27","John.18.27","Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew."
"26814","43","18","28","John.18.28","Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover."
"26815","43","18","29","John.18.29","Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?"
"26816","43","18","30","John.18.30","They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee."
"26817","43","18","31","John.18.31","Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:"
"26818","43","18","32","John.18.32","That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die."
"26819","43","18","33","John.18.33","Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?"
"26820","43","18","34","John.18.34","Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?"
"26821","43","18","35","John.18.35","Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?"
"26822","43","18","36","John.18.36","Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence."
"26823","43","18","37","John.18.37","Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice."
"26824","43","18","38","John.18.38","Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all."
"26825","43","18","39","John.18.39","But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?"
"26826","43","18","40","John.18.40","Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber."
"26827","43","19","1","John.19.1","Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him."
"26828","43","19","2","John.19.2","And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,"
"26829","43","19","3","John.19.3","And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands."
"26830","43","19","4","John.19.4","Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him."
"26831","43","19","5","John.19.5","Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!"
"26832","43","19","6","John.19.6","When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him."
"26833","43","19","7","John.19.7","The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."
"26834","43","19","8","John.19.8","When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;"
"26835","43","19","9","John.19.9","And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer."
"26836","43","19","10","John.19.10","Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?"
"26837","43","19","11","John.19.11","Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin."
"26838","43","19","12","John.19.12","And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar."
"26839","43","19","13","John.19.13","When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha."
"26840","43","19","14","John.19.14","And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!"
"26841","43","19","15","John.19.15","But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar."
"26842","43","19","16","John.19.16","Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away."
"26843","43","19","17","John.19.17","And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:"
"26844","43","19","18","John.19.18","Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst."
"26845","43","19","19","John.19.19","And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS."
"26846","43","19","20","John.19.20","This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin."
"26847","43","19","21","John.19.21","Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews."
"26848","43","19","22","John.19.22","Pilate answered, What I have written I have written."
"26849","43","19","23","John.19.23","Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout."
"26850","43","19","24","John.19.24","They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did."
"26851","43","19","25","John.19.25","Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene."
"26852","43","19","26","John.19.26","When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!"
"26853","43","19","27","John.19.27","Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home."
"26854","43","19","28","John.19.28","After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst."
"26855","43","19","29","John.19.29","Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth."
"26856","43","19","30","John.19.30","When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost."
"26857","43","19","31","John.19.31","The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away."
"26858","43","19","32","John.19.32","Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him."
"26859","43","19","33","John.19.33","But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:"
"26860","43","19","34","John.19.34","But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water."
"26861","43","19","35","John.19.35","And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe."
"26862","43","19","36","John.19.36","For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken."
"26863","43","19","37","John.19.37","And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced."
"26864","43","19","38","John.19.38","And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus."
"26865","43","19","39","John.19.39","And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight."
"26866","43","19","40","John.19.40","Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury."
"26867","43","19","41","John.19.41","Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid."
"26868","43","19","42","John.19.42","There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand."
"26869","43","20","1","John.20.1","The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre."
"26870","43","20","2","John.20.2","Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him."
"26871","43","20","3","John.20.3","Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre."
"26872","43","20","4","John.20.4","So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre."
"26873","43","20","5","John.20.5","And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in."
"26874","43","20","6","John.20.6","Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,"
"26875","43","20","7","John.20.7","And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself."
"26876","43","20","8","John.20.8","Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed."
"26877","43","20","9","John.20.9","For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead."
"26878","43","20","10","John.20.10","Then the disciples went away again unto their own home."
"26879","43","20","11","John.20.11","But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,"
"26880","43","20","12","John.20.12","And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain."
"26881","43","20","13","John.20.13","And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him."
"26882","43","20","14","John.20.14","And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus."
"26883","43","20","15","John.20.15","Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away."
"26884","43","20","16","John.20.16","Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master."
"26885","43","20","17","John.20.17","Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God."
"26886","43","20","18","John.20.18","Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her."
"26887","43","20","19","John.20.19","Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you."
"26888","43","20","20","John.20.20","And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord."
"26889","43","20","21","John.20.21","Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you."
"26890","43","20","22","John.20.22","And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:"
"26891","43","20","23","John.20.23","Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained."
"26892","43","20","24","John.20.24","But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came."
"26893","43","20","25","John.20.25","The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe."
"26894","43","20","26","John.20.26","And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you."
"26895","43","20","27","John.20.27","Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing."
"26896","43","20","28","John.20.28","And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God."
"26897","43","20","29","John.20.29","Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed."
"26898","43","20","30","John.20.30","And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:"
"26899","43","20","31","John.20.31","But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name."
"26900","43","21","1","John.21.1","After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself."
"26901","43","21","2","John.21.2","There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples."
"26902","43","21","3","John.21.3","Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing."

"26905","43","21","6","John.21.6","And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes."
"26906","43","21","7","John.21.7","Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea."
"26907","43","21","8","John.21.8","And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes."
"26908","43","21","9","John.21.9","As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread."

"26921","43","21","22","John.21.22","Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me."
"26922","43","21","23","John.21.23","Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?"
"26923","43","21","24","John.21.24","This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true."

"26976","44","2","26","Acts.2.26","Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:"
"26977","44","2","27","Acts.2.27","Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption."
"26978","44","2","28","Acts.2.28","Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance."
"26979","44","2","29","Acts.2.29","Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day."
"26980","44","2","30","Acts.2.30","Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;"
"26981","44","2","31","Acts.2.31","He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption."
"26982","44","2","32","Acts.2.32","This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses."
"26983","44","2","33","Acts.2.33","Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear."
"26984","44","2","34","Acts.2.34","For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,"
"26985","44","2","35","Acts.2.35","Until I make thy foes thy footstool."
"26986","44","2","36","Acts.2.36","Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ."
"26987","44","2","37","Acts.2.37","Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
"26988","44","2","38","Acts.2.38","Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
"26989","44","2","39","Acts.2.39","For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call."
"26990","44","2","40","Acts.2.40","And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation."
"26991","44","2","41","Acts.2.41","Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls."
"26992","44","2","42","Acts.2.42","And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers."
"26993","44","2","43","Acts.2.43","And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles."
"26994","44","2","44","Acts.2.44","And all that believed were together, and had all things common;"
"26995","44","2","45","Acts.2.45","And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need."
"26996","44","2","46","Acts.2.46","And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,"
"26997","44","2","47","Acts.2.47","Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved."
"26998","44","3","1","Acts.3.1","Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour."
"26999","44","3","2","Acts.3.2","And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;"
"27000","44","3","3","Acts.3.3","Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms."
"27001","44","3","4","Acts.3.4","And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us."
"27002","44","3","5","Acts.3.5","And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them."
"27003","44","3","6","Acts.3.6","Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk."
"27004","44","3","7","Acts.3.7","And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength."
"27005","44","3","8","Acts.3.8","And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God."
"27006","44","3","9","Acts.3.9","And all the people saw him walking and praising God:"
"27007","44","3","10","Acts.3.10","And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him."
"27008","44","3","11","Acts.3.11","And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering."
"27009","44","3","12","Acts.3.12","And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?"
"27010","44","3","13","Acts.3.13","The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go."
"27011","44","3","14","Acts.3.14","But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;"
"27012","44","3","15","Acts.3.15","And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses."
"27013","44","3","16","Acts.3.16","And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all."
"27014","44","3","17","Acts.3.17","And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers."
"27015","44","3","18","Acts.3.18","But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled."
"27016","44","3","19","Acts.3.19","Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;"
"27017","44","3","20","Acts.3.20","And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:"
"27018","44","3","21","Acts.3.21","Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began."
"27019","44","3","22","Acts.3.22","For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you."
"27020","44","3","23","Acts.3.23","And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people."
"27021","44","3","24","Acts.3.24","Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days."

"27024","44","4","1","Acts.4.1","And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,"
"27025","44","4","2","Acts.4.2","Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead."
"27026","44","4","3","Acts.4.3","And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide."
"27027","44","4","4","Acts.4.4","Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand."
"27028","44","4","5","Acts.4.5","And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,"
"27029","44","4","6","Acts.4.6","And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem."
"27030","44","4","7","Acts.4.7","And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?"
"27031","44","4","8","Acts.4.8","Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,"
"27032","44","4","9","Acts.4.9","If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;"
"27033","44","4","10","Acts.4.10","Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole."
"27034","44","4","11","Acts.4.11","This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner."
"27035","44","4","12","Acts.4.12","Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."
"27036","44","4","13","Acts.4.13","Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus."
"27037","44","4","14","Acts.4.14","And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it."
"27038","44","4","15","Acts.4.15","But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,"
"27039","44","4","16","Acts.4.16","Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it."
"27040","44","4","17","Acts.4.17","But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name."
"27041","44","4","18","Acts.4.18","And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus."
"27042","44","4","19","Acts.4.19","But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye."
"27043","44","4","20","Acts.4.20","For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard."
"27044","44","4","21","Acts.4.21","So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done."
"27045","44","4","22","Acts.4.22","For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed."
"27046","44","4","23","Acts.4.23","And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them."
"27047","44","4","24","Acts.4.24","And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:"
"27048","44","4","25","Acts.4.25","Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?"
"27049","44","4","26","Acts.4.26","The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ."
"27050","44","4","27","Acts.4.27","For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,"
"27051","44","4","28","Acts.4.28","For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done."
"27052","44","4","29","Acts.4.29","And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,"
"27053","44","4","30","Acts.4.30","By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus."
"27054","44","4","31","Acts.4.31","And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness."
"27055","44","4","32","Acts.4.32","And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common."
"27056","44","4","33","Acts.4.33","And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all."
"27057","44","4","34","Acts.4.34","Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,"
"27058","44","4","35","Acts.4.35","And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need."
"27059","44","4","36","Acts.4.36","And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,"
"27060","44","4","37","Acts.4.37","Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet."
"27061","44","5","1","Acts.5.1","But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,"
"27062","44","5","2","Acts.5.2","And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet."
"27063","44","5","3","Acts.5.3","But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?"
"27064","44","5","4","Acts.5.4","Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God."
"27065","44","5","5","Acts.5.5","And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things."
"27066","44","5","6","Acts.5.6","And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him."
"27067","44","5","7","Acts.5.7","And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in."
"27068","44","5","8","Acts.5.8","And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much."
"27069","44","5","9","Acts.5.9","Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out."
"27070","44","5","10","Acts.5.10","Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband."
"27071","44","5","11","Acts.5.11","And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things."
"27072","44","5","12","Acts.5.12","And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch."
"27073","44","5","13","Acts.5.13","And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them."
"27074","44","5","14","Acts.5.14","And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)"
"27075","44","5","15","Acts.5.15","Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them."
"27076","44","5","16","Acts.5.16","There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one."
"27077","44","5","17","Acts.5.17","Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,"
"27078","44","5","18","Acts.5.18","And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison."
"27079","44","5","19","Acts.5.19","But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,"
"27080","44","5","20","Acts.5.20","Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."
"27081","44","5","21","Acts.5.21","And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought."
"27082","44","5","22","Acts.5.22","But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,"
"27083","44","5","23","Acts.5.23","Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within."
"27084","44","5","24","Acts.5.24","Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow."
"27085","44","5","25","Acts.5.25","Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people."
"27086","44","5","26","Acts.5.26","Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned."
"27087","44","5","27","Acts.5.27","And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,"
"27088","44","5","28","Acts.5.28","Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us."
"27089","44","5","29","Acts.5.29","Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men."
"27090","44","5","30","Acts.5.30","The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree."
"27091","44","5","31","Acts.5.31","Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins."
"27092","44","5","32","Acts.5.32","And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him."
"27093","44","5","33","Acts.5.33","When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them."
"27094","44","5","34","Acts.5.34","Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;"
"27095","44","5","35","Acts.5.35","And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men."
"27096","44","5","36","Acts.5.36","For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought."
"27097","44","5","37","Acts.5.37","After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed."
"27098","44","5","38","Acts.5.38","And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:"
"27099","44","5","39","Acts.5.39","But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God."
"27100","44","5","40","Acts.5.40","And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go."
"27101","44","5","41","Acts.5.41","And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name."
"27102","44","5","42","Acts.5.42","And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ."
"27103","44","6","1","Acts.6.1","And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration."
"27104","44","6","2","Acts.6.2","Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables."
"27105","44","6","3","Acts.6.3","Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business."
"27106","44","6","4","Acts.6.4","But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word."
"27107","44","6","5","Acts.6.5","And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:"
"27108","44","6","6","Acts.6.6","Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them."
"27109","44","6","7","Acts.6.7","And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith."
"27110","44","6","8","Acts.6.8","And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people."
"27111","44","6","9","Acts.6.9","Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen."
"27112","44","6","10","Acts.6.10","And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake."
"27113","44","6","11","Acts.6.11","Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God."
"27114","44","6","12","Acts.6.12","And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,"
"27115","44","6","13","Acts.6.13","And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:"
"27116","44","6","14","Acts.6.14","For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us."
"27117","44","6","15","Acts.6.15","And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel."
"27118","44","7","1","Acts.7.1","Then said the high priest, Are these things so?"
"27119","44","7","2","Acts.7.2","And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,"
"27120","44","7","3","Acts.7.3","And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee."
"27121","44","7","4","Acts.7.4","Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell."
"27122","44","7","5","Acts.7.5","And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child."
"27123","44","7","6","Acts.7.6","And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years."
"27124","44","7","7","Acts.7.7","And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place."
"27125","44","7","8","Acts.7.8","And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs."
"27126","44","7","9","Acts.7.9","And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,"

"27428","44","14","13","Acts.14.13","Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people."
"27429","44","14","14","Acts.14.14","Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,"
"27430","44","14","15","Acts.14.15","And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:"
"27431","44","14","16","Acts.14.16","Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways."
"27432","44","14","17","Acts.14.17","Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."

"27434","44","14","19","Acts.14.19","And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead."
"27435","44","14","20","Acts.14.20","Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe."
"27436","44","14","21","Acts.14.21","And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,"
"27437","44","14","22","Acts.14.22","Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."
"27438","44","14","23","Acts.14.23","And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed."

"27440","44","14","25","Acts.14.25","And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:"
"27441","44","14","26","Acts.14.26","And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled."
"27442","44","14","27","Acts.14.27","And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles."
"27443","44","14","28","Acts.14.28","And there they abode long time with the disciples."
"27444","44","15","1","Acts.15.1","And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved."
"27445","44","15","2","Acts.15.2","When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question."
"27446","44","15","3","Acts.15.3","And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren."
"27447","44","15","4","Acts.15.4","And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them."
"27448","44","15","5","Acts.15.5","But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses."

"27450","44","15","7","Acts.15.7","And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe."

"27462","44","15","19","Acts.15.19","Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:"
"27463","44","15","20","Acts.15.20","But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood."
"27464","44","15","21","Acts.15.21","For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day."
"27465","44","15","22","Acts.15.22","Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:"
"27466","44","15","23","Acts.15.23","And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:"
"27467","44","15","24","Acts.15.24","Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:"

"27470","44","15","27","Acts.15.27","We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth."
"27471","44","15","28","Acts.15.28","For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;"
"27472","44","15","29","Acts.15.29","That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well."
"27473","44","15","30","Acts.15.30","So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:"
"27474","44","15","31","Acts.15.31","Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation."
"27475","44","15","32","Acts.15.32","And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them."
"27476","44","15","33","Acts.15.33","And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles."

"27480","44","15","37","Acts.15.37","And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark."
"27481","44","15","38","Acts.15.38","But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work."
"27482","44","15","39","Acts.15.39","And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;"
"27483","44","15","40","Acts.15.40","And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God."
"27484","44","15","41","Acts.15.41","And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches."
"27485","44","16","1","Acts.16.1","Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:"
"27486","44","16","2","Acts.16.2","Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium."
"27487","44","16","3","Acts.16.3","Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek."
"27488","44","16","4","Acts.16.4","And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem."
"27489","44","16","5","Acts.16.5","And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily."
"27490","44","16","6","Acts.16.6","Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,"
"27491","44","16","7","Acts.16.7","After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not."
"27492","44","16","8","Acts.16.8","And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas."
"27493","44","16","9","Acts.16.9","And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us."
"27494","44","16","10","Acts.16.10","And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them."
"27495","44","16","11","Acts.16.11","Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;"
"27496","44","16","12","Acts.16.12","And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days."
"27497","44","16","13","Acts.16.13","And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither."
"27498","44","16","14","Acts.16.14","And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul."
"27499","44","16","15","Acts.16.15","And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us."
"27500","44","16","16","Acts.16.16","And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:"
"27501","44","16","17","Acts.16.17","The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation."
"27502","44","16","18","Acts.16.18","And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour."
"27503","44","16","19","Acts.16.19","And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,"
"27504","44","16","20","Acts.16.20","And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,"
"27505","44","16","21","Acts.16.21","And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans."
"27506","44","16","22","Acts.16.22","And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them."
"27507","44","16","23","Acts.16.23","And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:"
"27508","44","16","24","Acts.16.24","Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks."
"27509","44","16","25","Acts.16.25","And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them."
"27510","44","16","26","Acts.16.26","And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed."
"27511","44","16","27","Acts.16.27","And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled."
"27512","44","16","28","Acts.16.28","But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here."
"27513","44","16","29","Acts.16.29","Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,"
"27514","44","16","30","Acts.16.30","And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
"27515","44","16","31","Acts.16.31","And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house."
"27516","44","16","32","Acts.16.32","And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house."
"27517","44","16","33","Acts.16.33","And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway."
"27518","44","16","34","Acts.16.34","And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house."
"27519","44","16","35","Acts.16.35","And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go."
"27520","44","16","36","Acts.16.36","And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace."
"27521","44","16","37","Acts.16.37","But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out."
"27522","44","16","38","Acts.16.38","And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans."
"27523","44","16","39","Acts.16.39","And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city."
"27524","44","16","40","Acts.16.40","And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed."
"27525","44","17","1","Acts.17.1","Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:"
"27526","44","17","2","Acts.17.2","And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,"
"27527","44","17","3","Acts.17.3","Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ."
"27528","44","17","4","Acts.17.4","And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few."
"27529","44","17","5","Acts.17.5","But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people."
"27530","44","17","6","Acts.17.6","And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;"
"27531","44","17","7","Acts.17.7","Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus."
"27532","44","17","8","Acts.17.8","And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things."
"27533","44","17","9","Acts.17.9","And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go."
"27534","44","17","10","Acts.17.10","And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews."
"27535","44","17","11","Acts.17.11","These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."
"27536","44","17","12","Acts.17.12","Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few."
"27537","44","17","13","Acts.17.13","But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people."
"27538","44","17","14","Acts.17.14","And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still."
"27539","44","17","15","Acts.17.15","And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed."
"27540","44","17","16","Acts.17.16","Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry."
"27541","44","17","17","Acts.17.17","Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him."
"27542","44","17","18","Acts.17.18","Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection."
"27543","44","17","19","Acts.17.19","And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?"
"27544","44","17","20","Acts.17.20","For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean."
"27545","44","17","21","Acts.17.21","For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)"
"27546","44","17","22","Acts.17.22","Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious."
"27547","44","17","23","Acts.17.23","For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."
"27548","44","17","24","Acts.17.24","God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;"
"27549","44","17","25","Acts.17.25","Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;"
"27550","44","17","26","Acts.17.26","And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;"
"27551","44","17","27","Acts.17.27","That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:"
"27552","44","17","28","Acts.17.28","For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring."
"27553","44","17","29","Acts.17.29","Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device."
"27554","44","17","30","Acts.17.30","And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:"
"27555","44","17","31","Acts.17.31","Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead."
"27556","44","17","32","Acts.17.32","And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter."
"27557","44","17","33","Acts.17.33","So Paul departed from among them."
"27558","44","17","34","Acts.17.34","Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them."
"27559","44","18","1","Acts.18.1","After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;"
"27560","44","18","2","Acts.18.2","And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them."
"27561","44","18","3","Acts.18.3","And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers."
"27562","44","18","4","Acts.18.4","And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks."
"27563","44","18","5","Acts.18.5","And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ."
"27564","44","18","6","Acts.18.6","And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles."
"27565","44","18","7","Acts.18.7","And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue."
"27566","44","18","8","Acts.18.8","And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized."
"27567","44","18","9","Acts.18.9","Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:"
"27568","44","18","10","Acts.18.10","For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city."
"27569","44","18","11","Acts.18.11","And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them."
"27570","44","18","12","Acts.18.12","And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,"
"27571","44","18","13","Acts.18.13","Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law."
"27572","44","18","14","Acts.18.14","And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:"
"27573","44","18","15","Acts.18.15","But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters."
"27574","44","18","16","Acts.18.16","And he drave them from the judgment seat."
"27575","44","18","17","Acts.18.17","Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things."
"27576","44","18","18","Acts.18.18","And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow."
"27577","44","18","19","Acts.18.19","And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews."
"27578","44","18","20","Acts.18.20","When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;"
"27579","44","18","21","Acts.18.21","But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus."
"27580","44","18","22","Acts.18.22","And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch."
"27581","44","18","23","Acts.18.23","And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples."
"27582","44","18","24","Acts.18.24","And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus."
"27583","44","18","25","Acts.18.25","This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John."
"27584","44","18","26","Acts.18.26","And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly."
"27585","44","18","27","Acts.18.27","And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:"
"27586","44","18","28","Acts.18.28","For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ."
"27587","44","19","1","Acts.19.1","And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,"
"27588","44","19","2","Acts.19.2","He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost."
"27589","44","19","3","Acts.19.3","And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism."
"27590","44","19","4","Acts.19.4","Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus."

"27592","44","19","6","Acts.19.6","And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied."

"27596","44","19","10","Acts.19.10","And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks."
"27597","44","19","11","Acts.19.11","And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:"
"27598","44","19","12","Acts.19.12","So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them."
"27599","44","19","13","Acts.19.13","Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth."
"27600","44","19","14","Acts.19.14","And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so."
"27601","44","19","15","Acts.19.15","And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?"
"27602","44","19","16","Acts.19.16","And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."
"27603","44","19","17","Acts.19.17","And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified."
"27604","44","19","18","Acts.19.18","And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds."
"27605","44","19","19","Acts.19.19","Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver."

"27610","44","19","24","Acts.19.24","For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;"
"27611","44","19","25","Acts.19.25","Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth."
"27612","44","19","26","Acts.19.26","Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:"
"27613","44","19","27","Acts.19.27","So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth."
"27614","44","19","28","Acts.19.28","And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
"27615","44","19","29","Acts.19.29","And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre."
"27616","44","19","30","Acts.19.30","And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not."
"27617","44","19","31","Acts.19.31","And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre."
"27618","44","19","32","Acts.19.32","Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together."

"27620","44","19","34","Acts.19.34","But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
"27621","44","19","35","Acts.19.35","And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?"
"27622","44","19","36","Acts.19.36","Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly."
"27623","44","19","37","Acts.19.37","For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess."
"27624","44","19","38","Acts.19.38","Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another."
"27625","44","19","39","Acts.19.39","But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly."
"27626","44","19","40","Acts.19.40","For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse."
"27627","44","19","41","Acts.19.41","And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly."
"27628","44","20","1","Acts.20.1","And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia."
"27629","44","20","2","Acts.20.2","And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,"
"27630","44","20","3","Acts.20.3","And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia."

"27636","44","20","9","Acts.20.9","And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead."
"27637","44","20","10","Acts.20.10","And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him."
"27638","44","20","11","Acts.20.11","When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed."
"27639","44","20","12","Acts.20.12","And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted."
"27640","44","20","13","Acts.20.13","And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot."
"27641","44","20","14","Acts.20.14","And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene."
"27642","44","20","15","Acts.20.15","And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus."
"27643","44","20","16","Acts.20.16","For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost."
"27644","44","20","17","Acts.20.17","And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church."
"27645","44","20","18","Acts.20.18","And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,"
"27646","44","20","19","Acts.20.19","Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:"
"27647","44","20","20","Acts.20.20","And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,"
"27648","44","20","21","Acts.20.21","Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."

"27651","44","20","24","Acts.20.24","But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God."
"27652","44","20","25","Acts.20.25","And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more."
"27653","44","20","26","Acts.20.26","Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men."
"27654","44","20","27","Acts.20.27","For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God."
"27655","44","20","28","Acts.20.28","Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood."

"27657","44","20","30","Acts.20.30","Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them."
"27658","44","20","31","Acts.20.31","Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears."
"27659","44","20","32","Acts.20.32","And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified."

"27661","44","20","34","Acts.20.34","Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me."
"27662","44","20","35","Acts.20.35","I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive."
"27663","44","20","36","Acts.20.36","And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all."
"27664","44","20","37","Acts.20.37","And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,"
"27665","44","20","38","Acts.20.38","Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship."
"27666","44","21","1","Acts.21.1","And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:"
"27667","44","21","2","Acts.21.2","And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth."
"27668","44","21","3","Acts.21.3","Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden."

"27673","44","21","8","Acts.21.8","And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him."
"27674","44","21","9","Acts.21.9","And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy."
"27675","44","21","10","Acts.21.10","And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus."
"27676","44","21","11","Acts.21.11","And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles."

"27694","44","21","29","Acts.21.29","For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)"
"27695","44","21","30","Acts.21.30","And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut."

"27716","44","22","11","Acts.22.11","And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus."
"27717","44","22","12","Acts.22.12","And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,"
"27718","44","22","13","Acts.22.13","Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him."
"27719","44","22","14","Acts.22.14","And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth."
"27720","44","22","15","Acts.22.15","For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard."
"27721","44","22","16","Acts.22.16","And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord."
"27722","44","22","17","Acts.22.17","And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;"
"27723","44","22","18","Acts.22.18","And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me."
"27724","44","22","19","Acts.22.19","And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:"
"27725","44","22","20","Acts.22.20","And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him."
"27726","44","22","21","Acts.22.21","And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles."
"27727","44","22","22","Acts.22.22","And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live."
"27728","44","22","23","Acts.22.23","And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,"
"27729","44","22","24","Acts.22.24","The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him."
"27730","44","22","25","Acts.22.25","And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?"
"27731","44","22","26","Acts.22.26","When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman."
"27732","44","22","27","Acts.22.27","Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea."
"27733","44","22","28","Acts.22.28","And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born."
"27734","44","22","29","Acts.22.29","Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him."
"27735","44","22","30","Acts.22.30","On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them."
"27736","44","23","1","Acts.23.1","And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day."
"27737","44","23","2","Acts.23.2","And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth."
"27738","44","23","3","Acts.23.3","Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?"
"27739","44","23","4","Acts.23.4","And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?"
"27740","44","23","5","Acts.23.5","Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people."
"27741","44","23","6","Acts.23.6","But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question."
"27742","44","23","7","Acts.23.7","And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided."
"27743","44","23","8","Acts.23.8","For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both."
"27744","44","23","9","Acts.23.9","And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God."
"27745","44","23","10","Acts.23.10","And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle."
"27746","44","23","11","Acts.23.11","And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome."
"27747","44","23","12","Acts.23.12","And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul."
"27748","44","23","13","Acts.23.13","And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy."
"27749","44","23","14","Acts.23.14","And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul."
"27750","44","23","15","Acts.23.15","Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him."
"27751","44","23","16","Acts.23.16","And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul."
"27752","44","23","17","Acts.23.17","Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him."
"27753","44","23","18","Acts.23.18","So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee."
"27754","44","23","19","Acts.23.19","Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?"
"27755","44","23","20","Acts.23.20","And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly."
"27756","44","23","21","Acts.23.21","But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee."
"27757","44","23","22","Acts.23.22","So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me."
"27758","44","23","23","Acts.23.23","And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;"
"27759","44","23","24","Acts.23.24","And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor."
"27760","44","23","25","Acts.23.25","And he wrote a letter after this manner:"
"27761","44","23","26","Acts.23.26","Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting."
"27762","44","23","27","Acts.23.27","This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman."
"27763","44","23","28","Acts.23.28","And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:"
"27764","44","23","29","Acts.23.29","Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds."
"27765","44","23","30","Acts.23.30","And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell."
"27766","44","23","31","Acts.23.31","Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris."
"27767","44","23","32","Acts.23.32","On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:"
"27768","44","23","33","Acts.23.33","Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him."
"27769","44","23","34","Acts.23.34","And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;"
"27770","44","23","35","Acts.23.35","I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall."
"27771","44","24","1","Acts.24.1","And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul."
"27772","44","24","2","Acts.24.2","And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,"
"27773","44","24","3","Acts.24.3","We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness."
"27774","44","24","4","Acts.24.4","Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words."
"27775","44","24","5","Acts.24.5","For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:"
"27776","44","24","6","Acts.24.6","Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law."
"27777","44","24","7","Acts.24.7","But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,"
"27778","44","24","8","Acts.24.8","Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him."
"27779","44","24","9","Acts.24.9","And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so."
"27780","44","24","10","Acts.24.10","Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:"
"27781","44","24","11","Acts.24.11","Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship."
"27782","44","24","12","Acts.24.12","And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:"
"27783","44","24","13","Acts.24.13","Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me."
"27784","44","24","14","Acts.24.14","But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:"
"27785","44","24","15","Acts.24.15","And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."
"27786","44","24","16","Acts.24.16","And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men."
"27787","44","24","17","Acts.24.17","Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings."
"27788","44","24","18","Acts.24.18","Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult."
"27789","44","24","19","Acts.24.19","Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me."
"27790","44","24","20","Acts.24.20","Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,"
"27791","44","24","21","Acts.24.21","Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day."
"27792","44","24","22","Acts.24.22","And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter."
"27793","44","24","23","Acts.24.23","And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him."
"27794","44","24","24","Acts.24.24","And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ."
"27795","44","24","25","Acts.24.25","And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee."
"27796","44","24","26","Acts.24.26","He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him."
"27797","44","24","27","Acts.24.27","But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound."
"27798","44","25","1","Acts.25.1","Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem."
"27799","44","25","2","Acts.25.2","Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,"
"27800","44","25","3","Acts.25.3","And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him."
"27801","44","25","4","Acts.25.4","But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither."
"27802","44","25","5","Acts.25.5","Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him."
"27803","44","25","6","Acts.25.6","And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought."
"27804","44","25","7","Acts.25.7","And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove."
"27805","44","25","8","Acts.25.8","While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all."
"27806","44","25","9","Acts.25.9","But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?"
"27807","44","25","10","Acts.25.10","Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest."
"27808","44","25","11","Acts.25.11","For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar."
"27809","44","25","12","Acts.25.12","Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go."
"27810","44","25","13","Acts.25.13","And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus."
"27811","44","25","14","Acts.25.14","And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:"
"27812","44","25","15","Acts.25.15","About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him."
"27813","44","25","16","Acts.25.16","To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him."
"27814","44","25","17","Acts.25.17","Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth."
"27815","44","25","18","Acts.25.18","Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:"
"27816","44","25","19","Acts.25.19","But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive."
"27817","44","25","20","Acts.25.20","And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters."
"27818","44","25","21","Acts.25.21","But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar."
"27819","44","25","22","Acts.25.22","Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him."
"27820","44","25","23","Acts.25.23","And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth."
"27821","44","25","24","Acts.25.24","And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer."
"27822","44","25","25","Acts.25.25","But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him."
"27823","44","25","26","Acts.25.26","Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write."
"27824","44","25","27","Acts.25.27","For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him."
"27825","44","26","1","Acts.26.1","Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:"
"27826","44","26","2","Acts.26.2","I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:"
"27827","44","26","3","Acts.26.3","Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently."
"27828","44","26","4","Acts.26.4","My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;"
"27829","44","26","5","Acts.26.5","Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee."
"27830","44","26","6","Acts.26.6","And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:"
"27831","44","26","7","Acts.26.7","Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews."
"27832","44","26","8","Acts.26.8","Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?"
"27833","44","26","9","Acts.26.9","I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
"27834","44","26","10","Acts.26.10","Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them."
"27835","44","26","11","Acts.26.11","And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities."
"27836","44","26","12","Acts.26.12","Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,"
"27837","44","26","13","Acts.26.13","At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me."
"27838","44","26","14","Acts.26.14","And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
"27839","44","26","15","Acts.26.15","And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest."
"27840","44","26","16","Acts.26.16","But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;"
"27841","44","26","17","Acts.26.17","Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,"
"27842","44","26","18","Acts.26.18","To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me."
"27843","44","26","19","Acts.26.19","Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:"
"27844","44","26","20","Acts.26.20","But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance."
"27845","44","26","21","Acts.26.21","For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me."
"27846","44","26","22","Acts.26.22","Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:"
"27847","44","26","23","Acts.26.23","That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles."
"27848","44","26","24","Acts.26.24","And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad."
"27849","44","26","25","Acts.26.25","But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness."
"27850","44","26","26","Acts.26.26","For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner."
"27851","44","26","27","Acts.26.27","King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest."
"27852","44","26","28","Acts.26.28","Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."
"27853","44","26","29","Acts.26.29","And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds."
"27854","44","26","30","Acts.26.30","And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:"
"27855","44","26","31","Acts.26.31","And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
"27856","44","26","32","Acts.26.32","Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar."
"27857","44","27","1","Acts.27.1","And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band."
"27858","44","27","2","Acts.27.2","And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us."
"27859","44","27","3","Acts.27.3","And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself."
"27860","44","27","4","Acts.27.4","And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary."
"27861","44","27","5","Acts.27.5","And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia."
"27862","44","27","6","Acts.27.6","And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein."
"27863","44","27","7","Acts.27.7","And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;"
"27864","44","27","8","Acts.27.8","And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea."
"27865","44","27","9","Acts.27.9","Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,"
"27866","44","27","10","Acts.27.10","And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives."
"27867","44","27","11","Acts.27.11","Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul."
"27868","44","27","12","Acts.27.12","And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west."
"27869","44","27","13","Acts.27.13","And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete."
"27870","44","27","14","Acts.27.14","But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon."
"27871","44","27","15","Acts.27.15","And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive."
"27872","44","27","16","Acts.27.16","And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:"
"27873","44","27","17","Acts.27.17","Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven."
"27874","44","27","18","Acts.27.18","And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;"
"27875","44","27","19","Acts.27.19","And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship."
"27876","44","27","20","Acts.27.20","And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away."
"27877","44","27","21","Acts.27.21","But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss."
"27878","44","27","22","Acts.27.22","And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship."
"27879","44","27","23","Acts.27.23","For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,"
"27880","44","27","24","Acts.27.24","Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee."
"27881","44","27","25","Acts.27.25","Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me."
"27882","44","27","26","Acts.27.26","Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island."
"27883","44","27","27","Acts.27.27","But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;"
"27884","44","27","28","Acts.27.28","And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms."
"27885","44","27","29","Acts.27.29","Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day."
"27886","44","27","30","Acts.27.30","And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,"
"27887","44","27","31","Acts.27.31","Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved."
"27888","44","27","32","Acts.27.32","Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off."
"27889","44","27","33","Acts.27.33","And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing."
"27890","44","27","34","Acts.27.34","Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you."
"27891","44","27","35","Acts.27.35","And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat."
"27892","44","27","36","Acts.27.36","Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat."
"27893","44","27","37","Acts.27.37","And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls."
"27894","44","27","38","Acts.27.38","And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea."
"27895","44","27","39","Acts.27.39","And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship."
"27896","44","27","40","Acts.27.40","And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore."
"27897","44","27","41","Acts.27.41","And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves."
"27898","44","27","42","Acts.27.42","And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape."
"27899","44","27","43","Acts.27.43","But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:"
"27900","44","27","44","Acts.27.44","And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land."
"27901","44","28","1","Acts.28.1","And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita."
"27902","44","28","2","Acts.28.2","And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold."
"27903","44","28","3","Acts.28.3","And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand."
"27904","44","28","4","Acts.28.4","And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live."
"27905","44","28","5","Acts.28.5","And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm."
"27906","44","28","6","Acts.28.6","Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god."
"27907","44","28","7","Acts.28.7","In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously."
"27908","44","28","8","Acts.28.8","And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him."
"27909","44","28","9","Acts.28.9","So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:"
"27910","44","28","10","Acts.28.10","Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary."
"27911","44","28","11","Acts.28.11","And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux."
"27912","44","28","12","Acts.28.12","And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days."
"27913","44","28","13","Acts.28.13","And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:"
"27914","44","28","14","Acts.28.14","Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome."
"27915","44","28","15","Acts.28.15","And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage."
"27916","44","28","16","Acts.28.16","And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him."
"27917","44","28","17","Acts.28.17","And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."
"27918","44","28","18","Acts.28.18","Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me."
"27919","44","28","19","Acts.28.19","But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of."
"27920","44","28","20","Acts.28.20","For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."
"27921","44","28","21","Acts.28.21","And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee."
"27922","44","28","22","Acts.28.22","But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against."
"27923","44","28","23","Acts.28.23","And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening."
"27924","44","28","24","Acts.28.24","And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not."
"27925","44","28","25","Acts.28.25","And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,"
"27926","44","28","26","Acts.28.26","Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:"
"27927","44","28","27","Acts.28.27","For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."
"27928","44","28","28","Acts.28.28","Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it."
"27929","44","28","29","Acts.28.29","And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves."
"27930","44","28","30","Acts.28.30","And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,"
"27931","44","28","31","Acts.28.31","Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him."
"27932","45","1","1","Rom.1.1","Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,"
"27933","45","1","2","Rom.1.2","Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)"
"27934","45","1","3","Rom.1.3","Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;"
"27935","45","1","4","Rom.1.4","And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:"
"27936","45","1","5","Rom.1.5","By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:"
"27937","45","1","6","Rom.1.6","Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:"
"27938","45","1","7","Rom.1.7","To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
"27939","45","1","8","Rom.1.8","First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world."
"27940","45","1","9","Rom.1.9","For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;"
"27941","45","1","10","Rom.1.10","Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you."
"27942","45","1","11","Rom.1.11","For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;"
"27943","45","1","12","Rom.1.12","That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me."
"27944","45","1","13","Rom.1.13","Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles."
"27945","45","1","14","Rom.1.14","I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise."
"27946","45","1","15","Rom.1.15","So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also."
"27947","45","1","16","Rom.1.16","For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."
"27948","45","1","17","Rom.1.17","For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith."
"27949","45","1","18","Rom.1.18","For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;"
"27950","45","1","19","Rom.1.19","Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them."
"27951","45","1","20","Rom.1.20","For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:"
"27952","45","1","21","Rom.1.21","Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened."
"27953","45","1","22","Rom.1.22","Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,"
"27954","45","1","23","Rom.1.23","And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things."
"27955","45","1","24","Rom.1.24","Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:"
"27956","45","1","25","Rom.1.25","Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen."
"27957","45","1","26","Rom.1.26","For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:"
"27958","45","1","27","Rom.1.27","And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet."
"27959","45","1","28","Rom.1.28","And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;"
"27960","45","1","29","Rom.1.29","Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,"
"27961","45","1","30","Rom.1.30","Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,"
"27962","45","1","31","Rom.1.31","Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:"
"27963","45","1","32","Rom.1.32","Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."
"27964","45","2","1","Rom.2.1","Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things."
"27965","45","2","2","Rom.2.2","But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things."
"27966","45","2","3","Rom.2.3","And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?"
"27967","45","2","4","Rom.2.4","Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?"
"27968","45","2","5","Rom.2.5","But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;"
"27969","45","2","6","Rom.2.6","Who will render to every man according to his deeds:"
"27970","45","2","7","Rom.2.7","To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:"
"27971","45","2","8","Rom.2.8","But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,"
"27972","45","2","9","Rom.2.9","Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;"
"27973","45","2","10","Rom.2.10","But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:"
"27974","45","2","11","Rom.2.11","For there is no respect of persons with God."
"27975","45","2","12","Rom.2.12","For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;"
"27976","45","2","13","Rom.2.13","For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified."
"27977","45","2","14","Rom.2.14","For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:"
"27978","45","2","15","Rom.2.15","Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)"
"27979","45","2","16","Rom.2.16","In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel."
"27980","45","2","17","Rom.2.17","Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,"
"27981","45","2","18","Rom.2.18","And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;"
"27982","45","2","19","Rom.2.19","And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,"
"27983","45","2","20","Rom.2.20","An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law."
"27984","45","2","21","Rom.2.21","Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?"
"27985","45","2","22","Rom.2.22","Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?"
"27986","45","2","23","Rom.2.23","Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?"
"27987","45","2","24","Rom.2.24","For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written."
"27988","45","2","25","Rom.2.25","For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision."
"27989","45","2","26","Rom.2.26","Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?"
"27990","45","2","27","Rom.2.27","And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?"
"27991","45","2","28","Rom.2.28","For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:"
"27992","45","2","29","Rom.2.29","But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God."
"27993","45","3","1","Rom.3.1","What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?"
"27994","45","3","2","Rom.3.2","Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God."
"27995","45","3","3","Rom.3.3","For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?"
"27996","45","3","4","Rom.3.4","God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged."
"27997","45","3","5","Rom.3.5","But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)"
"27998","45","3","6","Rom.3.6","God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?"
"27999","45","3","7","Rom.3.7","For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?"
"28000","45","3","8","Rom.3.8","And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just."
"28001","45","3","9","Rom.3.9","What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;"
"28002","45","3","10","Rom.3.10","As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"
"28003","45","3","11","Rom.3.11","There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God."
"28004","45","3","12","Rom.3.12","They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one."
"28005","45","3","13","Rom.3.13","Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:"

"28007","45","3","15","Rom.3.15","Their feet are swift to shed blood:"
"28008","45","3","16","Rom.3.16","Destruction and misery are in their ways:"
"28009","45","3","17","Rom.3.17","And the way of peace have they not known:"
"28010","45","3","18","Rom.3.18","There is no fear of God before their eyes."
"28011","45","3","19","Rom.3.19","Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God."
"28012","45","3","20","Rom.3.20","Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin."
"28013","45","3","21","Rom.3.21","But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;"
"28014","45","3","22","Rom.3.22","Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:"
"28015","45","3","23","Rom.3.23","For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"
"28016","45","3","24","Rom.3.24","Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:"
"28017","45","3","25","Rom.3.25","Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;"
"28018","45","3","26","Rom.3.26","To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus."
"28019","45","3","27","Rom.3.27","Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith."
"28020","45","3","28","Rom.3.28","Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law."
"28021","45","3","29","Rom.3.29","Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:"
"28022","45","3","30","Rom.3.30","Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith."
"28023","45","3","31","Rom.3.31","Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."
"28024","45","4","1","Rom.4.1","What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?"
"28025","45","4","2","Rom.4.2","For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God."
"28026","45","4","3","Rom.4.3","For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness."
"28027","45","4","4","Rom.4.4","Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt."
"28028","45","4","5","Rom.4.5","But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."
"28029","45","4","6","Rom.4.6","Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,"
"28030","45","4","7","Rom.4.7","Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered."
"28031","45","4","8","Rom.4.8","Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin."
"28032","45","4","9","Rom.4.9","Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness."
"28033","45","4","10","Rom.4.10","How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision."
"28034","45","4","11","Rom.4.11","And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:"
"28035","45","4","12","Rom.4.12","And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised."
"28036","45","4","13","Rom.4.13","For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith."
"28037","45","4","14","Rom.4.14","For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:"
"28038","45","4","15","Rom.4.15","Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression."
"28039","45","4","16","Rom.4.16","Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,"
"28040","45","4","17","Rom.4.17","As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were."
"28041","45","4","18","Rom.4.18","Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be."
"28042","45","4","19","Rom.4.19","And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:"
"28043","45","4","20","Rom.4.20","He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;"
"28044","45","4","21","Rom.4.21","And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform."
"28045","45","4","22","Rom.4.22","And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness."
"28046","45","4","23","Rom.4.23","Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;"
"28047","45","4","24","Rom.4.24","But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;"
"28048","45","4","25","Rom.4.25","Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification."
"28049","45","5","1","Rom.5.1","Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:"
"28050","45","5","2","Rom.5.2","By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
"28051","45","5","3","Rom.5.3","And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;"
"28052","45","5","4","Rom.5.4","And patience, experience; and experience, hope:"
"28053","45","5","5","Rom.5.5","And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."
"28054","45","5","6","Rom.5.6","For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly."
"28055","45","5","7","Rom.5.7","For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die."
"28056","45","5","8","Rom.5.8","But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
"28057","45","5","9","Rom.5.9","Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."
"28058","45","5","10","Rom.5.10","For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life."
"28059","45","5","11","Rom.5.11","And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement."
"28060","45","5","12","Rom.5.12","Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:"
"28061","45","5","13","Rom.5.13","For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law."
"28062","45","5","14","Rom.5.14","Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come."
"28063","45","5","15","Rom.5.15","But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many."
"28064","45","5","16","Rom.5.16","And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification."
"28065","45","5","17","Rom.5.17","For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)"
"28066","45","5","18","Rom.5.18","Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life."
"28067","45","5","19","Rom.5.19","For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous."
"28068","45","5","20","Rom.5.20","Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:"
"28069","45","5","21","Rom.5.21","That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."
"28070","45","6","1","Rom.6.1","What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
"28071","45","6","2","Rom.6.2","God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"
"28072","45","6","3","Rom.6.3","Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?"
"28073","45","6","4","Rom.6.4","Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
"28074","45","6","5","Rom.6.5","For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:"
"28075","45","6","6","Rom.6.6","Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin."
"28076","45","6","7","Rom.6.7","For he that is dead is freed from sin."
"28077","45","6","8","Rom.6.8","Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:"
"28078","45","6","9","Rom.6.9","Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him."
"28079","45","6","10","Rom.6.10","For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God."
"28080","45","6","11","Rom.6.11","Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
"28081","45","6","12","Rom.6.12","Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof."
"28082","45","6","13","Rom.6.13","Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God."
"28083","45","6","14","Rom.6.14","For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace."
"28084","45","6","15","Rom.6.15","What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid."
"28085","45","6","16","Rom.6.16","Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?"
"28086","45","6","17","Rom.6.17","But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you."
"28087","45","6","18","Rom.6.18","Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness."
"28088","45","6","19","Rom.6.19","I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness."
"28089","45","6","20","Rom.6.20","For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness."
"28090","45","6","21","Rom.6.21","What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death."
"28091","45","6","22","Rom.6.22","But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life."
"28092","45","6","23","Rom.6.23","For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
"28093","45","7","1","Rom.7.1","Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?"
"28094","45","7","2","Rom.7.2","For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband."
"28095","45","7","3","Rom.7.3","So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man."
"28096","45","7","4","Rom.7.4","Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God."
"28097","45","7","5","Rom.7.5","For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death."
"28098","45","7","6","Rom.7.6","But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter."
"28099","45","7","7","Rom.7.7","What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet."
"28100","45","7","8","Rom.7.8","But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead."
"28101","45","7","9","Rom.7.9","For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."
"28102","45","7","10","Rom.7.10","And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death."
"28103","45","7","11","Rom.7.11","For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me."
"28104","45","7","12","Rom.7.12","Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."
"28105","45","7","13","Rom.7.13","Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful."
"28106","45","7","14","Rom.7.14","For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."
"28107","45","7","15","Rom.7.15","For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I."
"28108","45","7","16","Rom.7.16","If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good."
"28109","45","7","17","Rom.7.17","Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
"28110","45","7","18","Rom.7.18","For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not."
"28111","45","7","19","Rom.7.19","For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do."
"28112","45","7","20","Rom.7.20","Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
"28113","45","7","21","Rom.7.21","I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me."
"28114","45","7","22","Rom.7.22","For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:"
"28115","45","7","23","Rom.7.23","But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."
"28116","45","7","24","Rom.7.24","O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
"28117","45","7","25","Rom.7.25","I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin."
"28118","45","8","1","Rom.8.1","There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
"28119","45","8","2","Rom.8.2","For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death."
"28120","45","8","3","Rom.8.3","For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:"
"28121","45","8","4","Rom.8.4","That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
"28122","45","8","5","Rom.8.5","For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit."
"28123","45","8","6","Rom.8.6","For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace."
"28124","45","8","7","Rom.8.7","Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."
"28125","45","8","8","Rom.8.8","So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God."
"28126","45","8","9","Rom.8.9","But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."
"28127","45","8","10","Rom.8.10","And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness."
"28128","45","8","11","Rom.8.11","But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you."
"28129","45","8","12","Rom.8.12","Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh."
"28130","45","8","13","Rom.8.13","For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live."
"28131","45","8","14","Rom.8.14","For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."
"28132","45","8","15","Rom.8.15","For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father."
"28133","45","8","16","Rom.8.16","The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:"
"28134","45","8","17","Rom.8.17","And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together."
"28135","45","8","18","Rom.8.18","For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us."
"28136","45","8","19","Rom.8.19","For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God."
"28137","45","8","20","Rom.8.20","For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,"
"28138","45","8","21","Rom.8.21","Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God."
"28139","45","8","22","Rom.8.22","For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now."
"28140","45","8","23","Rom.8.23","And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body."
"28141","45","8","24","Rom.8.24","For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?"
"28142","45","8","25","Rom.8.25","But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it."
"28143","45","8","26","Rom.8.26","Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
"28144","45","8","27","Rom.8.27","And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God."
"28145","45","8","28","Rom.8.28","And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."
"28146","45","8","29","Rom.8.29","For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren."
"28147","45","8","30","Rom.8.30","Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
"28148","45","8","31","Rom.8.31","What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?"
"28149","45","8","32","Rom.8.32","He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"
"28150","45","8","33","Rom.8.33","Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth."
"28151","45","8","34","Rom.8.34","Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us."
"28152","45","8","35","Rom.8.35","Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
"28153","45","8","36","Rom.8.36","As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
"28154","45","8","37","Rom.8.37","Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us."
"28155","45","8","38","Rom.8.38","For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,"
"28156","45","8","39","Rom.8.39","Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
"28157","45","9","1","Rom.9.1","I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,"
"28158","45","9","2","Rom.9.2","That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart."
"28159","45","9","3","Rom.9.3","For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:"
"28160","45","9","4","Rom.9.4","Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;"
"28161","45","9","5","Rom.9.5","Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen."
"28162","45","9","6","Rom.9.6","Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:"
"28163","45","9","7","Rom.9.7","Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called."
"28164","45","9","8","Rom.9.8","That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed."
"28165","45","9","9","Rom.9.9","For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son."
"28166","45","9","10","Rom.9.10","And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;"
"28167","45","9","11","Rom.9.11","For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)"
"28168","45","9","12","Rom.9.12","It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger."
"28169","45","9","13","Rom.9.13","As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated."
"28170","45","9","14","Rom.9.14","What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid."
"28171","45","9","15","Rom.9.15","For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
"28172","45","9","16","Rom.9.16","So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy."
"28173","45","9","17","Rom.9.17","For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth."
"28174","45","9","18","Rom.9.18","Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth."
"28175","45","9","19","Rom.9.19","Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?"
"28176","45","9","20","Rom.9.20","Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?"
"28177","45","9","21","Rom.9.21","Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?"
"28178","45","9","22","Rom.9.22","What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:"
"28179","45","9","23","Rom.9.23","And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,"
"28180","45","9","24","Rom.9.24","Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?"
"28181","45","9","25","Rom.9.25","As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved."
"28182","45","9","26","Rom.9.26","And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God."
"28183","45","9","27","Rom.9.27","Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:"
"28184","45","9","28","Rom.9.28","For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth."
"28185","45","9","29","Rom.9.29","And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha."
"28186","45","9","30","Rom.9.30","What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith."
"28187","45","9","31","Rom.9.31","But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness."
"28188","45","9","32","Rom.9.32","Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;"
"28189","45","9","33","Rom.9.33","As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
"28190","45","10","1","Rom.10.1","Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved."
"28191","45","10","2","Rom.10.2","For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge."
"28192","45","10","3","Rom.10.3","For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."
"28193","45","10","4","Rom.10.4","For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."
"28194","45","10","5","Rom.10.5","For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them."
"28195","45","10","6","Rom.10.6","But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)"
"28196","45","10","7","Rom.10.7","Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)"
"28197","45","10","8","Rom.10.8","But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;"
"28198","45","10","9","Rom.10.9","That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."
"28199","45","10","10","Rom.10.10","For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
"28200","45","10","11","Rom.10.11","For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
"28201","45","10","12","Rom.10.12","For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him."
"28202","45","10","13","Rom.10.13","For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
"28203","45","10","14","Rom.10.14","How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?"
"28204","45","10","15","Rom.10.15","And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!"
"28205","45","10","16","Rom.10.16","But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?"
"28206","45","10","17","Rom.10.17","So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."
"28207","45","10","18","Rom.10.18","But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world."
"28208","45","10","19","Rom.10.19","But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you."
"28209","45","10","20","Rom.10.20","But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me."
"28210","45","10","21","Rom.10.21","But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people."
"28211","45","11","1","Rom.11.1","I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."
"28212","45","11","2","Rom.11.2","God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,"
"28213","45","11","3","Rom.11.3","Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."
"28214","45","11","4","Rom.11.4","But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal."
"28215","45","11","5","Rom.11.5","Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace."
"28216","45","11","6","Rom.11.6","And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work."
"28217","45","11","7","Rom.11.7","What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded"
"28218","45","11","8","Rom.11.8","According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day."
"28219","45","11","9","Rom.11.9","And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:"
"28220","45","11","10","Rom.11.10","Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway."
"28221","45","11","11","Rom.11.11","I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy."
"28222","45","11","12","Rom.11.12","Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?"
"28223","45","11","13","Rom.11.13","For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:"
"28224","45","11","14","Rom.11.14","If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them."
"28225","45","11","15","Rom.11.15","For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?"
"28226","45","11","16","Rom.11.16","For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches."
"28227","45","11","17","Rom.11.17","And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;"
"28228","45","11","18","Rom.11.18","Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee."
"28229","45","11","19","Rom.11.19","Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in."
"28230","45","11","20","Rom.11.20","Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:"
"28231","45","11","21","Rom.11.21","For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee."
"28232","45","11","22","Rom.11.22","Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off."
"28233","45","11","23","Rom.11.23","And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again."
"28234","45","11","24","Rom.11.24","For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?"
"28235","45","11","25","Rom.11.25","For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in."
"28236","45","11","26","Rom.11.26","And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:"
"28237","45","11","27","Rom.11.27","For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins."
"28238","45","11","28","Rom.11.28","As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes."
"28239","45","11","29","Rom.11.29","For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance."
"28240","45","11","30","Rom.11.30","For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:"
"28241","45","11","31","Rom.11.31","Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy."
"28242","45","11","32","Rom.11.32","For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all."
"28243","45","11","33","Rom.11.33","O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!"
"28244","45","11","34","Rom.11.34","For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?"
"28245","45","11","35","Rom.11.35","Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?"
"28246","45","11","36","Rom.11.36","For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen."
"28247","45","12","1","Rom.12.1","I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service."
"28248","45","12","2","Rom.12.2","And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."
"28249","45","12","3","Rom.12.3","For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith."
"28250","45","12","4","Rom.12.4","For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:"
"28251","45","12","5","Rom.12.5","So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another."
"28252","45","12","6","Rom.12.6","Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;"

"28254","45","12","8","Rom.12.8","Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness."
"28255","45","12","9","Rom.12.9","Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good."

"28257","45","12","11","Rom.12.11","Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;"
"28258","45","12","12","Rom.12.12","Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;"
"28259","45","12","13","Rom.12.13","Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality."
"28260","45","12","14","Rom.12.14","Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not."
"28261","45","12","15","Rom.12.15","Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."
"28262","45","12","16","Rom.12.16","Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits."
"28263","45","12","17","Rom.12.17","Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men."

"28266","45","12","20","Rom.12.20","Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head."
"28267","45","12","21","Rom.12.21","Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."
"28268","45","13","1","Rom.13.1","Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God."

"28270","45","13","3","Rom.13.3","For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:"
"28271","45","13","4","Rom.13.4","For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil."
"28272","45","13","5","Rom.13.5","Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake."
"28273","45","13","6","Rom.13.6","For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing."
"28274","45","13","7","Rom.13.7","Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour."
"28275","45","13","8","Rom.13.8","Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law."
"28276","45","13","9","Rom.13.9","For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
"28277","45","13","10","Rom.13.10","Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."

"28288","45","14","7","Rom.14.7","For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself."

"28323","45","15","19","Rom.15.19","Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ."
"28324","45","15","20","Rom.15.20","Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:"
"28325","45","15","21","Rom.15.21","But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand."
"28326","45","15","22","Rom.15.22","For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you."
"28327","45","15","23","Rom.15.23","But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;"
"28328","45","15","24","Rom.15.24","Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company."
"28329","45","15","25","Rom.15.25","But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints."
"28330","45","15","26","Rom.15.26","For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem."
"28331","45","15","27","Rom.15.27","It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things."
"28332","45","15","28","Rom.15.28","When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain."
"28333","45","15","29","Rom.15.29","And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ."
"28334","45","15","30","Rom.15.30","Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;"
"28335","45","15","31","Rom.15.31","That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;"
"28336","45","15","32","Rom.15.32","That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed."
"28337","45","15","33","Rom.15.33","Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen."
"28338","45","16","1","Rom.16.1","I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:"
"28339","45","16","2","Rom.16.2","That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also."
"28340","45","16","3","Rom.16.3","Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:"
"28341","45","16","4","Rom.16.4","Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles."
"28342","45","16","5","Rom.16.5","Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ."
"28343","45","16","6","Rom.16.6","Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us."
"28344","45","16","7","Rom.16.7","Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me."
"28345","45","16","8","Rom.16.8","Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord."
"28346","45","16","9","Rom.16.9","Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved."
"28347","45","16","10","Rom.16.10","Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household."
"28348","45","16","11","Rom.16.11","Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord."
"28349","45","16","12","Rom.16.12","Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord."
"28350","45","16","13","Rom.16.13","Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine."
"28351","45","16","14","Rom.16.14","Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them."
"28352","45","16","15","Rom.16.15","Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them."
"28353","45","16","16","Rom.16.16","Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you."
"28354","45","16","17","Rom.16.17","Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them."
"28355","45","16","18","Rom.16.18","For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple."
"28356","45","16","19","Rom.16.19","For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil."
"28357","45","16","20","Rom.16.20","And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen."
"28358","45","16","21","Rom.16.21","Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you."

"28362","45","16","25","Rom.16.25","Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,"
"28363","45","16","26","Rom.16.26","But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:"

"28368","46","1","4","1Cor.1.4","I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;"
"28369","46","1","5","1Cor.1.5","That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;"
"28370","46","1","6","1Cor.1.6","Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:"
"28371","46","1","7","1Cor.1.7","So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
"28372","46","1","8","1Cor.1.8","Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
"28373","46","1","9","1Cor.1.9","God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord."
"28374","46","1","10","1Cor.1.10","Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
"28375","46","1","11","1Cor.1.11","For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you."
"28376","46","1","12","1Cor.1.12","Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ."
"28377","46","1","13","1Cor.1.13","Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?"
"28378","46","1","14","1Cor.1.14","I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;"
"28379","46","1","15","1Cor.1.15","Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name."
"28380","46","1","16","1Cor.1.16","And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other."
"28381","46","1","17","1Cor.1.17","For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect."
"28382","46","1","18","1Cor.1.18","For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God."
"28383","46","1","19","1Cor.1.19","For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
"28384","46","1","20","1Cor.1.20","Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?"
"28385","46","1","21","1Cor.1.21","For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
"28386","46","1","22","1Cor.1.22","For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:"
"28387","46","1","23","1Cor.1.23","But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;"
"28388","46","1","24","1Cor.1.24","But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
"28389","46","1","25","1Cor.1.25","Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
"28390","46","1","26","1Cor.1.26","For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:"
"28391","46","1","27","1Cor.1.27","But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;"
"28392","46","1","28","1Cor.1.28","And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:"
"28393","46","1","29","1Cor.1.29","That no flesh should glory in his presence."
"28394","46","1","30","1Cor.1.30","But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:"
"28395","46","1","31","1Cor.1.31","That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
"28396","46","2","1","1Cor.2.1","And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God."
"28397","46","2","2","1Cor.2.2","For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
"28398","46","2","3","1Cor.2.3","And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling."
"28399","46","2","4","1Cor.2.4","And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:"
"28400","46","2","5","1Cor.2.5","That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
"28401","46","2","6","1Cor.2.6","Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:"
"28402","46","2","7","1Cor.2.7","But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:"
"28403","46","2","8","1Cor.2.8","Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
"28404","46","2","9","1Cor.2.9","But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him."
"28405","46","2","10","1Cor.2.10","But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
"28406","46","2","11","1Cor.2.11","For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God."
"28407","46","2","12","1Cor.2.12","Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God."
"28408","46","2","13","1Cor.2.13","Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
"28409","46","2","14","1Cor.2.14","But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."
"28410","46","2","15","1Cor.2.15","But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man."
"28411","46","2","16","1Cor.2.16","For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."
"28412","46","3","1","1Cor.3.1","And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ."
"28413","46","3","2","1Cor.3.2","I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able."
"28414","46","3","3","1Cor.3.3","For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?"
"28415","46","3","4","1Cor.3.4","For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?"
"28416","46","3","5","1Cor.3.5","Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?"
"28417","46","3","6","1Cor.3.6","I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase."
"28418","46","3","7","1Cor.3.7","So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase."
"28419","46","3","8","1Cor.3.8","Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour."
"28420","46","3","9","1Cor.3.9","For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building."
"28421","46","3","10","1Cor.3.10","According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon."
"28422","46","3","11","1Cor.3.11","For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
"28423","46","3","12","1Cor.3.12","Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;"
"28424","46","3","13","1Cor.3.13","Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is."
"28425","46","3","14","1Cor.3.14","If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward."
"28426","46","3","15","1Cor.3.15","If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire."
"28427","46","3","16","1Cor.3.16","Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"
"28428","46","3","17","1Cor.3.17","If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are."
"28429","46","3","18","1Cor.3.18","Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise."
"28430","46","3","19","1Cor.3.19","For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness."
"28431","46","3","20","1Cor.3.20","And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."
"28432","46","3","21","1Cor.3.21","Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;"
"28433","46","3","22","1Cor.3.22","Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;"
"28434","46","3","23","1Cor.3.23","And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's."
"28435","46","4","1","1Cor.4.1","Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God."
"28436","46","4","2","1Cor.4.2","Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."
"28437","46","4","3","1Cor.4.3","But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self."
"28438","46","4","4","1Cor.4.4","For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord."
"28439","46","4","5","1Cor.4.5","Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God."
"28440","46","4","6","1Cor.4.6","And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another."
"28441","46","4","7","1Cor.4.7","For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?"
"28442","46","4","8","1Cor.4.8","Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you."
"28443","46","4","9","1Cor.4.9","For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men."
"28444","46","4","10","1Cor.4.10","We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised."
"28445","46","4","11","1Cor.4.11","Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;"
"28446","46","4","12","1Cor.4.12","And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:"
"28447","46","4","13","1Cor.4.13","Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day."
"28448","46","4","14","1Cor.4.14","I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you."
"28449","46","4","15","1Cor.4.15","For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel."
"28450","46","4","16","1Cor.4.16","Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me."
"28451","46","4","17","1Cor.4.17","For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church."
"28452","46","4","18","1Cor.4.18","Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you."
"28453","46","4","19","1Cor.4.19","But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power."
"28454","46","4","20","1Cor.4.20","For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power."
"28455","46","4","21","1Cor.4.21","What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?"
"28456","46","5","1","1Cor.5.1","It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife."
"28457","46","5","2","1Cor.5.2","And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you."
"28458","46","5","3","1Cor.5.3","For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,"
"28459","46","5","4","1Cor.5.4","In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
"28460","46","5","5","1Cor.5.5","To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
"28461","46","5","6","1Cor.5.6","Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?"
"28462","46","5","7","1Cor.5.7","Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:"
"28463","46","5","8","1Cor.5.8","Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
"28464","46","5","9","1Cor.5.9","I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:"
"28465","46","5","10","1Cor.5.10","Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world."
"28466","46","5","11","1Cor.5.11","But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat."
"28467","46","5","12","1Cor.5.12","For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?"
"28468","46","5","13","1Cor.5.13","But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person."
"28469","46","6","1","1Cor.6.1","Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?"
"28470","46","6","2","1Cor.6.2","Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
"28471","46","6","3","1Cor.6.3","Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?"
"28472","46","6","4","1Cor.6.4","If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church."
"28473","46","6","5","1Cor.6.5","I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?"
"28474","46","6","6","1Cor.6.6","But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers."
"28475","46","6","7","1Cor.6.7","Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?"
"28476","46","6","8","1Cor.6.8","Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren."
"28477","46","6","9","1Cor.6.9","Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,"
"28478","46","6","10","1Cor.6.10","Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."
"28479","46","6","11","1Cor.6.11","And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."
"28480","46","6","12","1Cor.6.12","All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any."
"28481","46","6","13","1Cor.6.13","Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body."
"28482","46","6","14","1Cor.6.14","And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power."
"28483","46","6","15","1Cor.6.15","Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid."
"28484","46","6","16","1Cor.6.16","What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh."
"28485","46","6","17","1Cor.6.17","But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."
"28486","46","6","18","1Cor.6.18","Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body."
"28487","46","6","19","1Cor.6.19","What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?"
"28488","46","6","20","1Cor.6.20","For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."
"28489","46","7","1","1Cor.7.1","Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman."
"28490","46","7","2","1Cor.7.2","Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."
"28491","46","7","3","1Cor.7.3","Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband."
"28492","46","7","4","1Cor.7.4","The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife."
"28493","46","7","5","1Cor.7.5","Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency."
"28494","46","7","6","1Cor.7.6","But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment."
"28495","46","7","7","1Cor.7.7","For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that."
"28496","46","7","8","1Cor.7.8","I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I."
"28497","46","7","9","1Cor.7.9","But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."
"28498","46","7","10","1Cor.7.10","And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:"
"28499","46","7","11","1Cor.7.11","But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife."
"28500","46","7","12","1Cor.7.12","But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away."
"28501","46","7","13","1Cor.7.13","And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him."
"28502","46","7","14","1Cor.7.14","For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy."
"28503","46","7","15","1Cor.7.15","But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace."
"28504","46","7","16","1Cor.7.16","For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?"
"28505","46","7","17","1Cor.7.17","But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches."
"28506","46","7","18","1Cor.7.18","Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised."
"28507","46","7","19","1Cor.7.19","Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."
"28508","46","7","20","1Cor.7.20","Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called."
"28509","46","7","21","1Cor.7.21","Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather."
"28510","46","7","22","1Cor.7.22","For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant."
"28511","46","7","23","1Cor.7.23","Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men."
"28512","46","7","24","1Cor.7.24","Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God."
"28513","46","7","25","1Cor.7.25","Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful."
"28514","46","7","26","1Cor.7.26","I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be."
"28515","46","7","27","1Cor.7.27","Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife."
"28516","46","7","28","1Cor.7.28","But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you."
"28517","46","7","29","1Cor.7.29","But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;"
"28518","46","7","30","1Cor.7.30","And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;"
"28519","46","7","31","1Cor.7.31","And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away."
"28520","46","7","32","1Cor.7.32","But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:"
"28521","46","7","33","1Cor.7.33","But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife."
"28522","46","7","34","1Cor.7.34","There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband."
"28523","46","7","35","1Cor.7.35","And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction."
"28524","46","7","36","1Cor.7.36","But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry."
"28525","46","7","37","1Cor.7.37","Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well."
"28526","46","7","38","1Cor.7.38","So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better."
"28527","46","7","39","1Cor.7.39","The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord."
"28528","46","7","40","1Cor.7.40","But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God."
"28529","46","8","1","1Cor.8.1","Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth."
"28530","46","8","2","1Cor.8.2","And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know."
"28531","46","8","3","1Cor.8.3","But if any man love God, the same is known of him."
"28532","46","8","4","1Cor.8.4","As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one."
"28533","46","8","5","1Cor.8.5","For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)"
"28534","46","8","6","1Cor.8.6","But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him."
"28535","46","8","7","1Cor.8.7","Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled."
"28536","46","8","8","1Cor.8.8","But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse."
"28537","46","8","9","1Cor.8.9","But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak."
"28538","46","8","10","1Cor.8.10","For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;"
"28539","46","8","11","1Cor.8.11","And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"
"28540","46","8","12","1Cor.8.12","But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ."
"28541","46","8","13","1Cor.8.13","Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend."
"28542","46","9","1","1Cor.9.1","Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?"
"28543","46","9","2","1Cor.9.2","If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord."
"28544","46","9","3","1Cor.9.3","Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,"
"28545","46","9","4","1Cor.9.4","Have we not power to eat and to drink?"
"28546","46","9","5","1Cor.9.5","Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?"
"28547","46","9","6","1Cor.9.6","Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?"
"28548","46","9","7","1Cor.9.7","Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?"
"28549","46","9","8","1Cor.9.8","Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?"
"28550","46","9","9","1Cor.9.9","For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?"
"28551","46","9","10","1Cor.9.10","Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope."
"28552","46","9","11","1Cor.9.11","If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?"
"28553","46","9","12","1Cor.9.12","If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ."
"28554","46","9","13","1Cor.9.13","Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?"
"28555","46","9","14","1Cor.9.14","Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel."
"28556","46","9","15","1Cor.9.15","But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void."
"28557","46","9","16","1Cor.9.16","For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!"
"28558","46","9","17","1Cor.9.17","For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me."
"28559","46","9","18","1Cor.9.18","What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel."
"28560","46","9","19","1Cor.9.19","For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more."
"28561","46","9","20","1Cor.9.20","And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;"
"28562","46","9","21","1Cor.9.21","To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law."
"28563","46","9","22","1Cor.9.22","To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some."
"28564","46","9","23","1Cor.9.23","And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you."
"28565","46","9","24","1Cor.9.24","Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain."
"28566","46","9","25","1Cor.9.25","And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible."
"28567","46","9","26","1Cor.9.26","I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:"
"28568","46","9","27","1Cor.9.27","But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."
"28569","46","10","1","1Cor.10.1","Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;"
"28570","46","10","2","1Cor.10.2","And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;"
"28571","46","10","3","1Cor.10.3","And did all eat the same spiritual meat;"
"28572","46","10","4","1Cor.10.4","And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ."
"28573","46","10","5","1Cor.10.5","But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness."
"28574","46","10","6","1Cor.10.6","Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted."
"28575","46","10","7","1Cor.10.7","Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."
"28576","46","10","8","1Cor.10.8","Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand."
"28577","46","10","9","1Cor.10.9","Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents."
"28578","46","10","10","1Cor.10.10","Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer."
"28579","46","10","11","1Cor.10.11","Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come."
"28580","46","10","12","1Cor.10.12","Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall."
"28581","46","10","13","1Cor.10.13","There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it."
"28582","46","10","14","1Cor.10.14","Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry."
"28583","46","10","15","1Cor.10.15","I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say."
"28584","46","10","16","1Cor.10.16","The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?"
"28585","46","10","17","1Cor.10.17","For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread."
"28586","46","10","18","1Cor.10.18","Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?"
"28587","46","10","19","1Cor.10.19","What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?"
"28588","46","10","20","1Cor.10.20","But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils."
"28589","46","10","21","1Cor.10.21","Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils."
"28590","46","10","22","1Cor.10.22","Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?"
"28591","46","10","23","1Cor.10.23","All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not."
"28592","46","10","24","1Cor.10.24","Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth."
"28593","46","10","25","1Cor.10.25","Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:"
"28594","46","10","26","1Cor.10.26","For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof."
"28595","46","10","27","1Cor.10.27","If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake."
"28596","46","10","28","1Cor.10.28","But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:"
"28597","46","10","29","1Cor.10.29","Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?"
"28598","46","10","30","1Cor.10.30","For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?"
"28599","46","10","31","1Cor.10.31","Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."
"28600","46","10","32","1Cor.10.32","Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:"
"28601","46","10","33","1Cor.10.33","Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved."
"28602","46","11","1","1Cor.11.1","Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ."
"28603","46","11","2","1Cor.11.2","Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you."
"28604","46","11","3","1Cor.11.3","But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God."
"28605","46","11","4","1Cor.11.4","Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head."
"28606","46","11","5","1Cor.11.5","But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven."
"28607","46","11","6","1Cor.11.6","For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered."
"28608","46","11","7","1Cor.11.7","For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man."
"28609","46","11","8","1Cor.11.8","For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man."
"28610","46","11","9","1Cor.11.9","Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man."
"28611","46","11","10","1Cor.11.10","For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels."
"28612","46","11","11","1Cor.11.11","Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord."
"28613","46","11","12","1Cor.11.12","For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God."
"28614","46","11","13","1Cor.11.13","Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?"
"28615","46","11","14","1Cor.11.14","Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?"
"28616","46","11","15","1Cor.11.15","But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering."
"28617","46","11","16","1Cor.11.16","But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God."
"28618","46","11","17","1Cor.11.17","Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse."
"28619","46","11","18","1Cor.11.18","For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it."
"28620","46","11","19","1Cor.11.19","For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you."
"28621","46","11","20","1Cor.11.20","When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper."
"28622","46","11","21","1Cor.11.21","For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken."
"28623","46","11","22","1Cor.11.22","What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not."
"28624","46","11","23","1Cor.11.23","For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:"
"28625","46","11","24","1Cor.11.24","And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me."
"28626","46","11","25","1Cor.11.25","After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me."
"28627","46","11","26","1Cor.11.26","For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come."
"28628","46","11","27","1Cor.11.27","Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."
"28629","46","11","28","1Cor.11.28","But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup."
"28630","46","11","29","1Cor.11.29","For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body."
"28631","46","11","30","1Cor.11.30","For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep."
"28632","46","11","31","1Cor.11.31","For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."
"28633","46","11","32","1Cor.11.32","But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world."
"28634","46","11","33","1Cor.11.33","Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another."
"28635","46","11","34","1Cor.11.34","And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come."
"28636","46","12","1","1Cor.12.1","Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant."
"28637","46","12","2","1Cor.12.2","Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led."
"28638","46","12","3","1Cor.12.3","Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."
"28639","46","12","4","1Cor.12.4","Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."
"28640","46","12","5","1Cor.12.5","And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord."
"28641","46","12","6","1Cor.12.6","And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all."
"28642","46","12","7","1Cor.12.7","But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal."
"28643","46","12","8","1Cor.12.8","For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;"
"28644","46","12","9","1Cor.12.9","To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;"
"28645","46","12","10","1Cor.12.10","To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:"
"28646","46","12","11","1Cor.12.11","But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will."
"28647","46","12","12","1Cor.12.12","For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ."
"28648","46","12","13","1Cor.12.13","For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit."
"28649","46","12","14","1Cor.12.14","For the body is not one member, but many."
"28650","46","12","15","1Cor.12.15","If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
"28651","46","12","16","1Cor.12.16","And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
"28652","46","12","17","1Cor.12.17","If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?"
"28653","46","12","18","1Cor.12.18","But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him."
"28654","46","12","19","1Cor.12.19","And if they were all one member, where were the body?"
"28655","46","12","20","1Cor.12.20","But now are they many members, yet but one body."
"28656","46","12","21","1Cor.12.21","And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
"28657","46","12","22","1Cor.12.22","Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:"
"28658","46","12","23","1Cor.12.23","And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness."
"28659","46","12","24","1Cor.12.24","For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:"
"28660","46","12","25","1Cor.12.25","That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another."
"28661","46","12","26","1Cor.12.26","And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it."
"28662","46","12","27","1Cor.12.27","Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
"28663","46","12","28","1Cor.12.28","And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues."
"28664","46","12","29","1Cor.12.29","Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?"
"28665","46","12","30","1Cor.12.30","Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?"
"28666","46","12","31","1Cor.12.31","But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way."
"28667","46","13","1","1Cor.13.1","Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."
"28668","46","13","2","1Cor.13.2","And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing."
"28669","46","13","3","1Cor.13.3","And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing."
"28670","46","13","4","1Cor.13.4","Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,"
"28671","46","13","5","1Cor.13.5","Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;"
"28672","46","13","6","1Cor.13.6","Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;"
"28673","46","13","7","1Cor.13.7","Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."
"28674","46","13","8","1Cor.13.8","Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away."
"28675","46","13","9","1Cor.13.9","For we know in part, and we prophesy in part."
"28676","46","13","10","1Cor.13.10","But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away."
"28677","46","13","11","1Cor.13.11","When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."
"28678","46","13","12","1Cor.13.12","For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."
"28679","46","13","13","1Cor.13.13","And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity."
"28680","46","14","1","1Cor.14.1","Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy."
"28681","46","14","2","1Cor.14.2","For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries."
"28682","46","14","3","1Cor.14.3","But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort."
"28683","46","14","4","1Cor.14.4","He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church."
"28684","46","14","5","1Cor.14.5","I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying."
"28685","46","14","6","1Cor.14.6","Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?"
"28686","46","14","7","1Cor.14.7","And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?"
"28687","46","14","8","1Cor.14.8","For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?"
"28688","46","14","9","1Cor.14.9","So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air."
"28689","46","14","10","1Cor.14.10","There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification."
"28690","46","14","11","1Cor.14.11","Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me."
"28691","46","14","12","1Cor.14.12","Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church."
"28692","46","14","13","1Cor.14.13","Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret."
"28693","46","14","14","1Cor.14.14","For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful."
"28694","46","14","15","1Cor.14.15","What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also."
"28695","46","14","16","1Cor.14.16","Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?"
"28696","46","14","17","1Cor.14.17","For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified."
"28697","46","14","18","1Cor.14.18","I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:"
"28698","46","14","19","1Cor.14.19","Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."
"28699","46","14","20","1Cor.14.20","Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men."
"28700","46","14","21","1Cor.14.21","In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord."
"28701","46","14","22","1Cor.14.22","Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe."
"28702","46","14","23","1Cor.14.23","If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?"
"28703","46","14","24","1Cor.14.24","But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:"
"28704","46","14","25","1Cor.14.25","And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth."
"28705","46","14","26","1Cor.14.26","How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying."
"28706","46","14","27","1Cor.14.27","If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret."
"28707","46","14","28","1Cor.14.28","But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God."
"28708","46","14","29","1Cor.14.29","Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge."
"28709","46","14","30","1Cor.14.30","If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace."
"28710","46","14","31","1Cor.14.31","For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted."
"28711","46","14","32","1Cor.14.32","And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets."
"28712","46","14","33","1Cor.14.33","For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints."
"28713","46","14","34","1Cor.14.34","Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law."
"28714","46","14","35","1Cor.14.35","And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."
"28715","46","14","36","1Cor.14.36","What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?"
"28716","46","14","37","1Cor.14.37","If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord."
"28717","46","14","38","1Cor.14.38","But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant."
"28718","46","14","39","1Cor.14.39","Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues."
"28719","46","14","40","1Cor.14.40","Let all things be done decently and in order."
"28720","46","15","1","1Cor.15.1","Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;"
"28721","46","15","2","1Cor.15.2","By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain."
"28722","46","15","3","1Cor.15.3","For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;"
"28723","46","15","4","1Cor.15.4","And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:"
"28724","46","15","5","1Cor.15.5","And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:"
"28725","46","15","6","1Cor.15.6","After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep."
"28726","46","15","7","1Cor.15.7","After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles."
"28727","46","15","8","1Cor.15.8","And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time."
"28728","46","15","9","1Cor.15.9","For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
"28729","46","15","10","1Cor.15.10","But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
"28730","46","15","11","1Cor.15.11","Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed."
"28731","46","15","12","1Cor.15.12","Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
"28732","46","15","13","1Cor.15.13","But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:"
"28733","46","15","14","1Cor.15.14","And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain."
"28734","46","15","15","1Cor.15.15","Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not."
"28735","46","15","16","1Cor.15.16","For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:"
"28736","46","15","17","1Cor.15.17","And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins."
"28737","46","15","18","1Cor.15.18","Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished."
"28738","46","15","19","1Cor.15.19","If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable."
"28739","46","15","20","1Cor.15.20","But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept."
"28740","46","15","21","1Cor.15.21","For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead."
"28741","46","15","22","1Cor.15.22","For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
"28742","46","15","23","1Cor.15.23","But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming."
"28743","46","15","24","1Cor.15.24","Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power."
"28744","46","15","25","1Cor.15.25","For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet."
"28745","46","15","26","1Cor.15.26","The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."
"28746","46","15","27","1Cor.15.27","For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him."
"28747","46","15","28","1Cor.15.28","And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."
"28748","46","15","29","1Cor.15.29","Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?"
"28749","46","15","30","1Cor.15.30","And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?"
"28750","46","15","31","1Cor.15.31","I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."
"28751","46","15","32","1Cor.15.32","If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die."
"28752","46","15","33","1Cor.15.33","Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners."
"28753","46","15","34","1Cor.15.34","Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame."
"28754","46","15","35","1Cor.15.35","But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?"
"28755","46","15","36","1Cor.15.36","Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:"
"28756","46","15","37","1Cor.15.37","And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:"
"28757","46","15","38","1Cor.15.38","But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body."
"28758","46","15","39","1Cor.15.39","All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds."
"28759","46","15","40","1Cor.15.40","There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another."
"28760","46","15","41","1Cor.15.41","There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory."
"28761","46","15","42","1Cor.15.42","So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:"
"28762","46","15","43","1Cor.15.43","It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:"
"28763","46","15","44","1Cor.15.44","It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."
"28764","46","15","45","1Cor.15.45","And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit."
"28765","46","15","46","1Cor.15.46","Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual."
"28766","46","15","47","1Cor.15.47","The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven."
"28767","46","15","48","1Cor.15.48","As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly."
"28768","46","15","49","1Cor.15.49","And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."
"28769","46","15","50","1Cor.15.50","Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption."
"28770","46","15","51","1Cor.15.51","Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,"
"28771","46","15","52","1Cor.15.52","In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."
"28772","46","15","53","1Cor.15.53","For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."
"28773","46","15","54","1Cor.15.54","So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
"28774","46","15","55","1Cor.15.55","O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"
"28775","46","15","56","1Cor.15.56","The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law."
"28776","46","15","57","1Cor.15.57","But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
"28777","46","15","58","1Cor.15.58","Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."
"28778","46","16","1","1Cor.16.1","Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye."
"28779","46","16","2","1Cor.16.2","Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come."
"28780","46","16","3","1Cor.16.3","And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem."
"28781","46","16","4","1Cor.16.4","And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me."
"28782","46","16","5","1Cor.16.5","Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia."
"28783","46","16","6","1Cor.16.6","And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go."
"28784","46","16","7","1Cor.16.7","For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit."
"28785","46","16","8","1Cor.16.8","But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost."
"28786","46","16","9","1Cor.16.9","For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries."
"28787","46","16","10","1Cor.16.10","Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do."
"28788","46","16","11","1Cor.16.11","Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren."
"28789","46","16","12","1Cor.16.12","As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time."
"28790","46","16","13","1Cor.16.13","Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong."
"28791","46","16","14","1Cor.16.14","Let all your things be done with charity."
"28792","46","16","15","1Cor.16.15","I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)"
"28793","46","16","16","1Cor.16.16","That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth."
"28794","46","16","17","1Cor.16.17","I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied."
"28795","46","16","18","1Cor.16.18","For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such."
"28796","46","16","19","1Cor.16.19","The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house."
"28797","46","16","20","1Cor.16.20","All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss."
"28798","46","16","21","1Cor.16.21","The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand."
"28799","46","16","22","1Cor.16.22","If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha."
"28800","46","16","23","1Cor.16.23","The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."
"28801","46","16","24","1Cor.16.24","My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen."
"28802","47","1","1","2Cor.1.1","Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:"
"28803","47","1","2","2Cor.1.2","Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
"28804","47","1","3","2Cor.1.3","Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;"
"28805","47","1","4","2Cor.1.4","Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God."
"28806","47","1","5","2Cor.1.5","For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ."
"28807","47","1","6","2Cor.1.6","And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation."
"28808","47","1","7","2Cor.1.7","And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation."
"28809","47","1","8","2Cor.1.8","For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:"
"28810","47","1","9","2Cor.1.9","But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:"
"28811","47","1","10","2Cor.1.10","Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;"
"28812","47","1","11","2Cor.1.11","Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf."
"28813","47","1","12","2Cor.1.12","For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward."
"28814","47","1","13","2Cor.1.13","For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;"
"28815","47","1","14","2Cor.1.14","As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus."
"28816","47","1","15","2Cor.1.15","And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;"
"28817","47","1","16","2Cor.1.16","And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea."
"28818","47","1","17","2Cor.1.17","When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?"
"28819","47","1","18","2Cor.1.18","But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay."
"28820","47","1","19","2Cor.1.19","For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea."
"28821","47","1","20","2Cor.1.20","For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us."
"28822","47","1","21","2Cor.1.21","Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;"
"28823","47","1","22","2Cor.1.22","Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
"28824","47","1","23","2Cor.1.23","Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth."
"28825","47","1","24","2Cor.1.24","Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand."
"28826","47","2","1","2Cor.2.1","But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness."
"28827","47","2","2","2Cor.2.2","For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?"
"28828","47","2","3","2Cor.2.3","And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all."
"28829","47","2","4","2Cor.2.4","For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you."
"28830","47","2","5","2Cor.2.5","But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all."
"28831","47","2","6","2Cor.2.6","Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many."
"28832","47","2","7","2Cor.2.7","So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow."
"28833","47","2","8","2Cor.2.8","Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him."
"28834","47","2","9","2Cor.2.9","For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things."
"28835","47","2","10","2Cor.2.10","To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;"
"28836","47","2","11","2Cor.2.11","Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices."
"28837","47","2","12","2Cor.2.12","Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,"
"28838","47","2","13","2Cor.2.13","I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia."
"28839","47","2","14","2Cor.2.14","Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place."
"28840","47","2","15","2Cor.2.15","For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:"
"28841","47","2","16","2Cor.2.16","To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?"
"28842","47","2","17","2Cor.2.17","For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ."
"28843","47","3","1","2Cor.3.1","Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?"
"28844","47","3","2","2Cor.3.2","Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:"
"28845","47","3","3","2Cor.3.3","Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart."
"28846","47","3","4","2Cor.3.4","And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:"
"28847","47","3","5","2Cor.3.5","Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;"
"28848","47","3","6","2Cor.3.6","Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life."
"28849","47","3","7","2Cor.3.7","But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:"
"28850","47","3","8","2Cor.3.8","How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?"
"28851","47","3","9","2Cor.3.9","For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory."
"28852","47","3","10","2Cor.3.10","For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth."
"28853","47","3","11","2Cor.3.11","For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious."
"28854","47","3","12","2Cor.3.12","Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:"
"28855","47","3","13","2Cor.3.13","And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:"
"28856","47","3","14","2Cor.3.14","But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ."
"28857","47","3","15","2Cor.3.15","But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart."
"28858","47","3","16","2Cor.3.16","Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away."
"28859","47","3","17","2Cor.3.17","Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
"28860","47","3","18","2Cor.3.18","But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord."
"28861","47","4","1","2Cor.4.1","Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;"
"28862","47","4","2","2Cor.4.2","But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."
"28863","47","4","3","2Cor.4.3","But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:"
"28864","47","4","4","2Cor.4.4","In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."
"28865","47","4","5","2Cor.4.5","For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake."
"28866","47","4","6","2Cor.4.6","For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
"28867","47","4","7","2Cor.4.7","But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us."
"28868","47","4","8","2Cor.4.8","We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;"
"28869","47","4","9","2Cor.4.9","Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;"
"28870","47","4","10","2Cor.4.10","Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body."
"28871","47","4","11","2Cor.4.11","For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh."
"28872","47","4","12","2Cor.4.12","So then death worketh in us, but life in you."
"28873","47","4","13","2Cor.4.13","We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;"
"28874","47","4","14","2Cor.4.14","Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you."
"28875","47","4","15","2Cor.4.15","For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God."
"28876","47","4","16","2Cor.4.16","For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day."
"28877","47","4","17","2Cor.4.17","For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;"
"28878","47","4","18","2Cor.4.18","While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."
"28879","47","5","1","2Cor.5.1","For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
"28880","47","5","2","2Cor.5.2","For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:"
"28881","47","5","3","2Cor.5.3","If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked."
"28882","47","5","4","2Cor.5.4","For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."
"28883","47","5","5","2Cor.5.5","Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit."
"28884","47","5","6","2Cor.5.6","Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:"
"28885","47","5","7","2Cor.5.7","For we walk by faith, not by sight:)"
"28886","47","5","8","2Cor.5.8","We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord."
"28887","47","5","9","2Cor.5.9","Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him."
"28888","47","5","10","2Cor.5.10","For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."
"28889","47","5","11","2Cor.5.11","Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences."
"28890","47","5","12","2Cor.5.12","For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart."
"28891","47","5","13","2Cor.5.13","For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause."
"28892","47","5","14","2Cor.5.14","For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:"
"28893","47","5","15","2Cor.5.15","And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again."
"28894","47","5","16","2Cor.5.16","Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more."
"28895","47","5","17","2Cor.5.17","Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
"28896","47","5","18","2Cor.5.18","And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;"
"28897","47","5","19","2Cor.5.19","To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation."
"28898","47","5","20","2Cor.5.20","Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."
"28899","47","5","21","2Cor.5.21","For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
"28900","47","6","1","2Cor.6.1","We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain."
"28901","47","6","2","2Cor.6.2","For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)"
"28902","47","6","3","2Cor.6.3","Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:"
"28903","47","6","4","2Cor.6.4","But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,"
"28904","47","6","5","2Cor.6.5","In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;"
"28905","47","6","6","2Cor.6.6","By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,"
"28906","47","6","7","2Cor.6.7","By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,"
"28907","47","6","8","2Cor.6.8","By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;"
"28908","47","6","9","2Cor.6.9","As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;"
"28909","47","6","10","2Cor.6.10","As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things."
"28910","47","6","11","2Cor.6.11","O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged."
"28911","47","6","12","2Cor.6.12","Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels."
"28912","47","6","13","2Cor.6.13","Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged."
"28913","47","6","14","2Cor.6.14","Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?"
"28914","47","6","15","2Cor.6.15","And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?"
"28915","47","6","16","2Cor.6.16","And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
"28916","47","6","17","2Cor.6.17","Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,"
"28917","47","6","18","2Cor.6.18","And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."
"28918","47","7","1","2Cor.7.1","Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
"28919","47","7","2","2Cor.7.2","Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man."
"28920","47","7","3","2Cor.7.3","I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you."
"28921","47","7","4","2Cor.7.4","Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation."
"28922","47","7","5","2Cor.7.5","For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears."
"28923","47","7","6","2Cor.7.6","Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;"
"28924","47","7","7","2Cor.7.7","And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more."
"28925","47","7","8","2Cor.7.8","For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season."
"28926","47","7","9","2Cor.7.9","Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing."
"28927","47","7","10","2Cor.7.10","For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death."
"28928","47","7","11","2Cor.7.11","For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter."
"28929","47","7","12","2Cor.7.12","Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you."
"28930","47","7","13","2Cor.7.13","Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all."
"28931","47","7","14","2Cor.7.14","For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth."
"28932","47","7","15","2Cor.7.15","And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him."
"28933","47","7","16","2Cor.7.16","I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things."
"28934","47","8","1","2Cor.8.1","Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;"
"28935","47","8","2","2Cor.8.2","How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality."
"28936","47","8","3","2Cor.8.3","For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;"
"28937","47","8","4","2Cor.8.4","Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints."
"28938","47","8","5","2Cor.8.5","And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God."
"28939","47","8","6","2Cor.8.6","Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also."
"28940","47","8","7","2Cor.8.7","Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also."
"28941","47","8","8","2Cor.8.8","I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love."
"28942","47","8","9","2Cor.8.9","For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich."
"28943","47","8","10","2Cor.8.10","And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago."
"28944","47","8","11","2Cor.8.11","Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have."
"28945","47","8","12","2Cor.8.12","For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not."
"28946","47","8","13","2Cor.8.13","For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:"
"28947","47","8","14","2Cor.8.14","But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:"
"28948","47","8","15","2Cor.8.15","As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack."
"28949","47","8","16","2Cor.8.16","But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you."
"28950","47","8","17","2Cor.8.17","For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you."
"28951","47","8","18","2Cor.8.18","And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;"
"28952","47","8","19","2Cor.8.19","And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:"
"28953","47","8","20","2Cor.8.20","Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:"
"28954","47","8","21","2Cor.8.21","Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."
"28955","47","8","22","2Cor.8.22","And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you."
"28956","47","8","23","2Cor.8.23","Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ."
"28957","47","8","24","2Cor.8.24","Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf."
"28958","47","9","1","2Cor.9.1","For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:"
"28959","47","9","2","2Cor.9.2","For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many."
"28960","47","9","3","2Cor.9.3","Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:"
"28961","47","9","4","2Cor.9.4","Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting."
"28962","47","9","5","2Cor.9.5","Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness."
"28963","47","9","6","2Cor.9.6","But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully."
"28964","47","9","7","2Cor.9.7","Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver."
"28965","47","9","8","2Cor.9.8","And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:"
"28966","47","9","9","2Cor.9.9","As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever."
"28967","47","9","10","2Cor.9.10","Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)"
"28968","47","9","11","2Cor.9.11","Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God."
"28969","47","9","12","2Cor.9.12","For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;"
"28970","47","9","13","2Cor.9.13","Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;"
"28971","47","9","14","2Cor.9.14","And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you."
"28972","47","9","15","2Cor.9.15","Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift."
"28973","47","10","1","2Cor.10.1","Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:"
"28974","47","10","2","2Cor.10.2","But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh."
"28975","47","10","3","2Cor.10.3","For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:"
"28976","47","10","4","2Cor.10.4","For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)"
"28977","47","10","5","2Cor.10.5","Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;"
"28978","47","10","6","2Cor.10.6","And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled."
"28979","47","10","7","2Cor.10.7","Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's."
"28980","47","10","8","2Cor.10.8","For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:"
"28981","47","10","9","2Cor.10.9","That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters."
"28982","47","10","10","2Cor.10.10","For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible."
"28983","47","10","11","2Cor.10.11","Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present."
"28984","47","10","12","2Cor.10.12","For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."
"28985","47","10","13","2Cor.10.13","But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you."
"28986","47","10","14","2Cor.10.14","For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:"
"28987","47","10","15","2Cor.10.15","Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,"
"28988","47","10","16","2Cor.10.16","To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand."
"28989","47","10","17","2Cor.10.17","But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
"28990","47","10","18","2Cor.10.18","For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth."
"28991","47","11","1","2Cor.11.1","Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me."
"28992","47","11","2","2Cor.11.2","For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ."
"28993","47","11","3","2Cor.11.3","But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."
"28994","47","11","4","2Cor.11.4","For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him."
"28995","47","11","5","2Cor.11.5","For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles."
"28996","47","11","6","2Cor.11.6","But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things."
"28997","47","11","7","2Cor.11.7","Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?"
"28998","47","11","8","2Cor.11.8","I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service."
"28999","47","11","9","2Cor.11.9","And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself."
"29000","47","11","10","2Cor.11.10","As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia."
"29001","47","11","11","2Cor.11.11","Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth."
"29002","47","11","12","2Cor.11.12","But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we."
"29003","47","11","13","2Cor.11.13","For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ."
"29004","47","11","14","2Cor.11.14","And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light."
"29005","47","11","15","2Cor.11.15","Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works."
"29006","47","11","16","2Cor.11.16","I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little."
"29007","47","11","17","2Cor.11.17","That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting."
"29008","47","11","18","2Cor.11.18","Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also."
"29009","47","11","19","2Cor.11.19","For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise."
"29010","47","11","20","2Cor.11.20","For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face."
"29011","47","11","21","2Cor.11.21","I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also."
"29012","47","11","22","2Cor.11.22","Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I."
"29013","47","11","23","2Cor.11.23","Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft."
"29014","47","11","24","2Cor.11.24","Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one."
"29015","47","11","25","2Cor.11.25","Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;"
"29016","47","11","26","2Cor.11.26","In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;"
"29017","47","11","27","2Cor.11.27","In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness."
"29018","47","11","28","2Cor.11.28","Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches."
"29019","47","11","29","2Cor.11.29","Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?"
"29020","47","11","30","2Cor.11.30","If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities."
"29021","47","11","31","2Cor.11.31","The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not."
"29022","47","11","32","2Cor.11.32","In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:"
"29023","47","11","33","2Cor.11.33","And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands."
"29024","47","12","1","2Cor.12.1","It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord."
"29025","47","12","2","2Cor.12.2","I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven."
"29026","47","12","3","2Cor.12.3","And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)"
"29027","47","12","4","2Cor.12.4","How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."
"29028","47","12","5","2Cor.12.5","Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities."
"29029","47","12","6","2Cor.12.6","For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me."
"29030","47","12","7","2Cor.12.7","And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure."
"29031","47","12","8","2Cor.12.8","For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me."
"29032","47","12","9","2Cor.12.9","And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me."
"29033","47","12","10","2Cor.12.10","Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong."
"29034","47","12","11","2Cor.12.11","I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing."
"29035","47","12","12","2Cor.12.12","Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds."
"29036","47","12","13","2Cor.12.13","For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong."
"29037","47","12","14","2Cor.12.14","Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children."
"29038","47","12","15","2Cor.12.15","And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved."
"29039","47","12","16","2Cor.12.16","But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile."
"29040","47","12","17","2Cor.12.17","Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?"
"29041","47","12","18","2Cor.12.18","I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?"
"29042","47","12","19","2Cor.12.19","Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying."
"29043","47","12","20","2Cor.12.20","For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:"
"29044","47","12","21","2Cor.12.21","And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed."
"29045","47","13","1","2Cor.13.1","This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established."
"29046","47","13","2","2Cor.13.2","I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:"
"29047","47","13","3","2Cor.13.3","Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you."
"29048","47","13","4","2Cor.13.4","For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you."
"29049","47","13","5","2Cor.13.5","Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?"
"29050","47","13","6","2Cor.13.6","But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates."
"29051","47","13","7","2Cor.13.7","Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates."
"29052","47","13","8","2Cor.13.8","For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."
"29053","47","13","9","2Cor.13.9","For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection."
"29054","47","13","10","2Cor.13.10","Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction."
"29055","47","13","11","2Cor.13.11","Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you."
"29056","47","13","12","2Cor.13.12","Greet one another with an holy kiss."
"29057","47","13","13","2Cor.13.13","All the saints salute you."
"29058","47","13","14","2Cor.13.14","The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen."
"29059","48","1","1","Gal.1.1","Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)"
"29060","48","1","2","Gal.1.2","And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:"
"29061","48","1","3","Gal.1.3","Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,"
"29062","48","1","4","Gal.1.4","Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:"
"29063","48","1","5","Gal.1.5","To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."
"29064","48","1","6","Gal.1.6","I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:"
"29065","48","1","7","Gal.1.7","Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ."
"29066","48","1","8","Gal.1.8","But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."
"29067","48","1","9","Gal.1.9","As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed."
"29068","48","1","10","Gal.1.10","For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ."
"29069","48","1","11","Gal.1.11","But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man."
"29070","48","1","12","Gal.1.12","For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ."
"29071","48","1","13","Gal.1.13","For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:"
"29072","48","1","14","Gal.1.14","And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers."
"29073","48","1","15","Gal.1.15","But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,"
"29074","48","1","16","Gal.1.16","To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:"
"29075","48","1","17","Gal.1.17","Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus."
"29076","48","1","18","Gal.1.18","Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days."
"29077","48","1","19","Gal.1.19","But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother."
"29078","48","1","20","Gal.1.20","Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not."
"29079","48","1","21","Gal.1.21","Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;"
"29080","48","1","22","Gal.1.22","And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:"
"29081","48","1","23","Gal.1.23","But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed."
"29082","48","1","24","Gal.1.24","And they glorified God in me."
"29083","48","2","1","Gal.2.1","Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also."
"29084","48","2","2","Gal.2.2","And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain."
"29085","48","2","3","Gal.2.3","But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:"
"29086","48","2","4","Gal.2.4","And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:"
"29087","48","2","5","Gal.2.5","To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you."
"29088","48","2","6","Gal.2.6","But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:"
"29089","48","2","7","Gal.2.7","But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;"
"29090","48","2","8","Gal.2.8","For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)"
"29091","48","2","9","Gal.2.9","And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision."
"29092","48","2","10","Gal.2.10","Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do."
"29093","48","2","11","Gal.2.11","But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed."
"29094","48","2","12","Gal.2.12","For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision."
"29095","48","2","13","Gal.2.13","And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation."
"29096","48","2","14","Gal.2.14","But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"
"29097","48","2","15","Gal.2.15","We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,"
"29098","48","2","16","Gal.2.16","Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."
"29099","48","2","17","Gal.2.17","But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid."
"29100","48","2","18","Gal.2.18","For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor."
"29101","48","2","19","Gal.2.19","For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God."
"29102","48","2","20","Gal.2.20","I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."
"29103","48","2","21","Gal.2.21","I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain."
"29104","48","3","1","Gal.3.1","O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?"
"29105","48","3","2","Gal.3.2","This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
"29106","48","3","3","Gal.3.3","Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?"
"29107","48","3","4","Gal.3.4","Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain."
"29108","48","3","5","Gal.3.5","He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
"29109","48","3","6","Gal.3.6","Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."
"29110","48","3","7","Gal.3.7","Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham."
"29111","48","3","8","Gal.3.8","And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed."
"29112","48","3","9","Gal.3.9","So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham."
"29113","48","3","10","Gal.3.10","For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them."
"29114","48","3","11","Gal.3.11","But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith."
"29115","48","3","12","Gal.3.12","And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them."
"29116","48","3","13","Gal.3.13","Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:"
"29117","48","3","14","Gal.3.14","That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."
"29118","48","3","15","Gal.3.15","Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto."
"29119","48","3","16","Gal.3.16","Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."
"29120","48","3","17","Gal.3.17","And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect."
"29121","48","3","18","Gal.3.18","For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise."
"29122","48","3","19","Gal.3.19","Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator."
"29123","48","3","20","Gal.3.20","Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one."
"29124","48","3","21","Gal.3.21","Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law."
"29125","48","3","22","Gal.3.22","But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe."
"29126","48","3","23","Gal.3.23","But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed."
"29127","48","3","24","Gal.3.24","Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith."
"29128","48","3","25","Gal.3.25","But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."
"29129","48","3","26","Gal.3.26","For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus."
"29130","48","3","27","Gal.3.27","For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ."
"29131","48","3","28","Gal.3.28","There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."
"29132","48","3","29","Gal.3.29","And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."
"29133","48","4","1","Gal.4.1","Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;"
"29134","48","4","2","Gal.4.2","But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father."
"29135","48","4","3","Gal.4.3","Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:"
"29136","48","4","4","Gal.4.4","But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,"
"29137","48","4","5","Gal.4.5","To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."
"29138","48","4","6","Gal.4.6","And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father."
"29139","48","4","7","Gal.4.7","Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."
"29140","48","4","8","Gal.4.8","Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods."
"29141","48","4","9","Gal.4.9","But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?"
"29142","48","4","10","Gal.4.10","Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years."
"29143","48","4","11","Gal.4.11","I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain."
"29144","48","4","12","Gal.4.12","Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all."
"29145","48","4","13","Gal.4.13","Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first."
"29146","48","4","14","Gal.4.14","And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus."
"29147","48","4","15","Gal.4.15","Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me."
"29148","48","4","16","Gal.4.16","Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?"
"29149","48","4","17","Gal.4.17","They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them."
"29150","48","4","18","Gal.4.18","But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you."
"29151","48","4","19","Gal.4.19","My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,"
"29152","48","4","20","Gal.4.20","I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you."
"29153","48","4","21","Gal.4.21","Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?"
"29154","48","4","22","Gal.4.22","For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman."
"29155","48","4","23","Gal.4.23","But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise."
"29156","48","4","24","Gal.4.24","Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar."
"29157","48","4","25","Gal.4.25","For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children."
"29158","48","4","26","Gal.4.26","But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all."
"29159","48","4","27","Gal.4.27","For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband."
"29160","48","4","28","Gal.4.28","Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise."
"29161","48","4","29","Gal.4.29","But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now."
"29162","48","4","30","Gal.4.30","Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman."
"29163","48","4","31","Gal.4.31","So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free."
"29164","48","5","1","Gal.5.1","Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."
"29165","48","5","2","Gal.5.2","Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."
"29166","48","5","3","Gal.5.3","For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law."
"29167","48","5","4","Gal.5.4","Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace."
"29168","48","5","5","Gal.5.5","For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith."
"29169","48","5","6","Gal.5.6","For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love."
"29170","48","5","7","Gal.5.7","Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?"
"29171","48","5","8","Gal.5.8","This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you."
"29172","48","5","9","Gal.5.9","A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump."
"29173","48","5","10","Gal.5.10","I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be."
"29174","48","5","11","Gal.5.11","And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased."
"29175","48","5","12","Gal.5.12","I would they were even cut off which trouble you."
"29176","48","5","13","Gal.5.13","For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another."
"29177","48","5","14","Gal.5.14","For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
"29178","48","5","15","Gal.5.15","But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another."
"29179","48","5","16","Gal.5.16","This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh."
"29180","48","5","17","Gal.5.17","For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would."
"29181","48","5","18","Gal.5.18","But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law."
"29182","48","5","19","Gal.5.19","Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,"
"29183","48","5","20","Gal.5.20","Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,"
"29184","48","5","21","Gal.5.21","Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
"29185","48","5","22","Gal.5.22","But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,"
"29186","48","5","23","Gal.5.23","Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law."
"29187","48","5","24","Gal.5.24","And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts."
"29188","48","5","25","Gal.5.25","If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."
"29189","48","5","26","Gal.5.26","Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another."
"29190","48","6","1","Gal.6.1","Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted."
"29191","48","6","2","Gal.6.2","Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ."
"29192","48","6","3","Gal.6.3","For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself."
"29193","48","6","4","Gal.6.4","But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another."
"29194","48","6","5","Gal.6.5","For every man shall bear his own burden."
"29195","48","6","6","Gal.6.6","Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things."
"29196","48","6","7","Gal.6.7","Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."
"29197","48","6","8","Gal.6.8","For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting."
"29198","48","6","9","Gal.6.9","And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."
"29199","48","6","10","Gal.6.10","As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith."
"29200","48","6","11","Gal.6.11","Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand."
"29201","48","6","12","Gal.6.12","As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ."
"29202","48","6","13","Gal.6.13","For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh."
"29203","48","6","14","Gal.6.14","But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world."
"29204","48","6","15","Gal.6.15","For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature."
"29205","48","6","16","Gal.6.16","And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God."
"29206","48","6","17","Gal.6.17","From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus."
"29207","48","6","18","Gal.6.18","Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
"29208","49","1","1","Eph.1.1","Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:"
"29209","49","1","2","Eph.1.2","Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
"29210","49","1","3","Eph.1.3","Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:"

"29219","49","1","12","Eph.1.12","That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ."
"29220","49","1","13","Eph.1.13","In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,"

"29224","49","1","17","Eph.1.17","That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:"
"29225","49","1","18","Eph.1.18","The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,"
"29226","49","1","19","Eph.1.19","And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,"
"29227","49","1","20","Eph.1.20","Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,"
"29228","49","1","21","Eph.1.21","Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:"
"29229","49","1","22","Eph.1.22","And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,"
"29230","49","1","23","Eph.1.23","Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all."
"29231","49","2","1","Eph.2.1","And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;"
"29232","49","2","2","Eph.2.2","Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:"
"29233","49","2","3","Eph.2.3","Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others."
"29234","49","2","4","Eph.2.4","But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,"
"29235","49","2","5","Eph.2.5","Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)"

"29247","49","2","17","Eph.2.17","And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh."
"29248","49","2","18","Eph.2.18","For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father."
"29249","49","2","19","Eph.2.19","Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;"
"29250","49","2","20","Eph.2.20","And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;"
"29251","49","2","21","Eph.2.21","In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:"
"29252","49","2","22","Eph.2.22","In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit."
"29253","49","3","1","Eph.3.1","For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,"
"29254","49","3","2","Eph.3.2","If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:"
"29255","49","3","3","Eph.3.3","How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,"
"29256","49","3","4","Eph.3.4","Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)"
"29257","49","3","5","Eph.3.5","Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;"
"29258","49","3","6","Eph.3.6","That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:"
"29259","49","3","7","Eph.3.7","Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power."
"29260","49","3","8","Eph.3.8","Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;"
"29261","49","3","9","Eph.3.9","And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:"
"29262","49","3","10","Eph.3.10","To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,"
"29263","49","3","11","Eph.3.11","According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:"
"29264","49","3","12","Eph.3.12","In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him."
"29265","49","3","13","Eph.3.13","Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory."
"29266","49","3","14","Eph.3.14","For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
"29267","49","3","15","Eph.3.15","Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,"
"29268","49","3","16","Eph.3.16","That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;"
"29269","49","3","17","Eph.3.17","That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,"
"29270","49","3","18","Eph.3.18","May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;"
"29271","49","3","19","Eph.3.19","And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God."
"29272","49","3","20","Eph.3.20","Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,"
"29273","49","3","21","Eph.3.21","Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen."
"29274","49","4","1","Eph.4.1","I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,"
"29275","49","4","2","Eph.4.2","With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;"
"29276","49","4","3","Eph.4.3","Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
"29277","49","4","4","Eph.4.4","There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;"
"29278","49","4","5","Eph.4.5","One Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
"29279","49","4","6","Eph.4.6","One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all."
"29280","49","4","7","Eph.4.7","But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ."
"29281","49","4","8","Eph.4.8","Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men."
"29282","49","4","9","Eph.4.9","Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?"
"29283","49","4","10","Eph.4.10","He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)"
"29284","49","4","11","Eph.4.11","And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;"
"29285","49","4","12","Eph.4.12","For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:"
"29286","49","4","13","Eph.4.13","Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:"
"29287","49","4","14","Eph.4.14","That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;"
"29288","49","4","15","Eph.4.15","But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:"
"29289","49","4","16","Eph.4.16","From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
"29290","49","4","17","Eph.4.17","This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,"
"29291","49","4","18","Eph.4.18","Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:"
"29292","49","4","19","Eph.4.19","Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness."
"29293","49","4","20","Eph.4.20","But ye have not so learned Christ;"
"29294","49","4","21","Eph.4.21","If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:"
"29295","49","4","22","Eph.4.22","That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;"
"29296","49","4","23","Eph.4.23","And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;"
"29297","49","4","24","Eph.4.24","And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."
"29298","49","4","25","Eph.4.25","Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another."
"29299","49","4","26","Eph.4.26","Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:"
"29300","49","4","27","Eph.4.27","Neither give place to the devil."
"29301","49","4","28","Eph.4.28","Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth."
"29302","49","4","29","Eph.4.29","Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers."
"29303","49","4","30","Eph.4.30","And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption."
"29304","49","4","31","Eph.4.31","Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:"
"29305","49","4","32","Eph.4.32","And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you."
"29306","49","5","1","Eph.5.1","Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;"
"29307","49","5","2","Eph.5.2","And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour."
"29308","49","5","3","Eph.5.3","But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;"
"29309","49","5","4","Eph.5.4","Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks."
"29310","49","5","5","Eph.5.5","For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
"29311","49","5","6","Eph.5.6","Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience."
"29312","49","5","7","Eph.5.7","Be not ye therefore partakers with them."
"29313","49","5","8","Eph.5.8","For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:"
"29314","49","5","9","Eph.5.9","For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)"
"29315","49","5","10","Eph.5.10","Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord."
"29316","49","5","11","Eph.5.11","And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them."
"29317","49","5","12","Eph.5.12","For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret."
"29318","49","5","13","Eph.5.13","But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light."
"29319","49","5","14","Eph.5.14","Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light."
"29320","49","5","15","Eph.5.15","See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,"
"29321","49","5","16","Eph.5.16","Redeeming the time, because the days are evil."
"29322","49","5","17","Eph.5.17","Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is."
"29323","49","5","18","Eph.5.18","And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;"
"29324","49","5","19","Eph.5.19","Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;"
"29325","49","5","20","Eph.5.20","Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
"29326","49","5","21","Eph.5.21","Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God."
"29327","49","5","22","Eph.5.22","Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord."
"29328","49","5","23","Eph.5.23","For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body."
"29329","49","5","24","Eph.5.24","Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing."
"29330","49","5","25","Eph.5.25","Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;"
"29331","49","5","26","Eph.5.26","That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,"
"29332","49","5","27","Eph.5.27","That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish."
"29333","49","5","28","Eph.5.28","So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself."
"29334","49","5","29","Eph.5.29","For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:"
"29335","49","5","30","Eph.5.30","For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones."
"29336","49","5","31","Eph.5.31","For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh."
"29337","49","5","32","Eph.5.32","This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church."
"29338","49","5","33","Eph.5.33","Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband."
"29339","49","6","1","Eph.6.1","Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right."
"29340","49","6","2","Eph.6.2","Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)"
"29341","49","6","3","Eph.6.3","That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth."
"29342","49","6","4","Eph.6.4","And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."
"29343","49","6","5","Eph.6.5","Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;"
"29344","49","6","6","Eph.6.6","Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;"
"29345","49","6","7","Eph.6.7","With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:"
"29346","49","6","8","Eph.6.8","Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free."
"29347","49","6","9","Eph.6.9","And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him."
"29348","49","6","10","Eph.6.10","Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might."
"29349","49","6","11","Eph.6.11","Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."
"29350","49","6","12","Eph.6.12","For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."
"29351","49","6","13","Eph.6.13","Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
"29352","49","6","14","Eph.6.14","Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;"
"29353","49","6","15","Eph.6.15","And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;"
"29354","49","6","16","Eph.6.16","Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."
"29355","49","6","17","Eph.6.17","And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:"
"29356","49","6","18","Eph.6.18","Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;"
"29357","49","6","19","Eph.6.19","And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,"
"29358","49","6","20","Eph.6.20","For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
"29359","49","6","21","Eph.6.21","But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:"
"29360","49","6","22","Eph.6.22","Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts."
"29361","49","6","23","Eph.6.23","Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
"29362","49","6","24","Eph.6.24","Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen."
"29363","50","1","1","Phil.1.1","Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:"
"29364","50","1","2","Phil.1.2","Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
"29365","50","1","3","Phil.1.3","I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,"
"29366","50","1","4","Phil.1.4","Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,"
"29367","50","1","5","Phil.1.5","For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;"
"29368","50","1","6","Phil.1.6","Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:"
"29369","50","1","7","Phil.1.7","Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace."
"29370","50","1","8","Phil.1.8","For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ."
"29371","50","1","9","Phil.1.9","And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;"
"29372","50","1","10","Phil.1.10","That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;"
"29373","50","1","11","Phil.1.11","Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God."
"29374","50","1","12","Phil.1.12","But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;"
"29375","50","1","13","Phil.1.13","So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;"
"29376","50","1","14","Phil.1.14","And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear."
"29377","50","1","15","Phil.1.15","Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:"
"29378","50","1","16","Phil.1.16","The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:"
"29379","50","1","17","Phil.1.17","But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel."
"29380","50","1","18","Phil.1.18","What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice."
"29381","50","1","19","Phil.1.19","For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,"
"29382","50","1","20","Phil.1.20","According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death."
"29383","50","1","21","Phil.1.21","For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
"29384","50","1","22","Phil.1.22","But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not."
"29385","50","1","23","Phil.1.23","For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:"
"29386","50","1","24","Phil.1.24","Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you."
"29387","50","1","25","Phil.1.25","And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;"
"29388","50","1","26","Phil.1.26","That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again."
"29389","50","1","27","Phil.1.27","Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;"
"29390","50","1","28","Phil.1.28","And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God."
"29391","50","1","29","Phil.1.29","For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;"
"29392","50","1","30","Phil.1.30","Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me."
"29393","50","2","1","Phil.2.1","If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,"
"29394","50","2","2","Phil.2.2","Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind."
"29395","50","2","3","Phil.2.3","Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves."
"29396","50","2","4","Phil.2.4","Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others."
"29397","50","2","5","Phil.2.5","Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:"
"29398","50","2","6","Phil.2.6","Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:"
"29399","50","2","7","Phil.2.7","But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:"
"29400","50","2","8","Phil.2.8","And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."
"29401","50","2","9","Phil.2.9","Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:"
"29402","50","2","10","Phil.2.10","That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;"
"29403","50","2","11","Phil.2.11","And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
"29404","50","2","12","Phil.2.12","Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
"29405","50","2","13","Phil.2.13","For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure."
"29406","50","2","14","Phil.2.14","Do all things without murmurings and disputings:"
"29407","50","2","15","Phil.2.15","That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;"
"29408","50","2","16","Phil.2.16","Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain."
"29409","50","2","17","Phil.2.17","Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all."
"29410","50","2","18","Phil.2.18","For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me."
"29411","50","2","19","Phil.2.19","But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state."
"29412","50","2","20","Phil.2.20","For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state."
"29413","50","2","21","Phil.2.21","For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's."
"29414","50","2","22","Phil.2.22","But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel."
"29415","50","2","23","Phil.2.23","Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me."
"29416","50","2","24","Phil.2.24","But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly."
"29417","50","2","25","Phil.2.25","Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants."
"29418","50","2","26","Phil.2.26","For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick."
"29419","50","2","27","Phil.2.27","For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow."
"29420","50","2","28","Phil.2.28","I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful."
"29421","50","2","29","Phil.2.29","Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:"
"29422","50","2","30","Phil.2.30","Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me."
"29423","50","3","1","Phil.3.1","Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe."
"29424","50","3","2","Phil.3.2","Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision."
"29425","50","3","3","Phil.3.3","For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh."
"29426","50","3","4","Phil.3.4","Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:"

"29428","50","3","6","Phil.3.6","Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless."
"29429","50","3","7","Phil.3.7","But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ."
"29430","50","3","8","Phil.3.8","Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,"

"29437","50","3","15","Phil.3.15","Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you."
"29438","50","3","16","Phil.3.16","Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing."

"29511","51","2","16","Col.2.16","Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:"

"29520","51","3","2","Col.3.2","Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."
"29521","51","3","3","Col.3.3","For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."
"29522","51","3","4","Col.3.4","When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory."
"29523","51","3","5","Col.3.5","Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:"

"29578","52","2","7","1Thess.2.7","But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:"
"29579","52","2","8","1Thess.2.8","So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us."
"29580","52","2","9","1Thess.2.9","For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God."
"29581","52","2","10","1Thess.2.10","Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:"
"29582","52","2","11","1Thess.2.11","As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,"
"29583","52","2","12","1Thess.2.12","That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory."
"29584","52","2","13","1Thess.2.13","For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe."
"29585","52","2","14","1Thess.2.14","For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:"
"29586","52","2","15","1Thess.2.15","Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:"
"29587","52","2","16","1Thess.2.16","Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost."
"29588","52","2","17","1Thess.2.17","But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire."
"29589","52","2","18","1Thess.2.18","Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us."
"29590","52","2","19","1Thess.2.19","For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?"
"29591","52","2","20","1Thess.2.20","For ye are our glory and joy."
"29592","52","3","1","1Thess.3.1","Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;"
"29593","52","3","2","1Thess.3.2","And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:"
"29594","52","3","3","1Thess.3.3","That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto."
"29595","52","3","4","1Thess.3.4","For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know."
"29596","52","3","5","1Thess.3.5","For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain."
"29597","52","3","6","1Thess.3.6","But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:"
"29598","52","3","7","1Thess.3.7","Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:"
"29599","52","3","8","1Thess.3.8","For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord."
"29600","52","3","9","1Thess.3.9","For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;"
"29601","52","3","10","1Thess.3.10","Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"
"29602","52","3","11","1Thess.3.11","Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you."
"29603","52","3","12","1Thess.3.12","And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:"
"29604","52","3","13","1Thess.3.13","To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints."
"29605","52","4","1","1Thess.4.1","Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more."
"29606","52","4","2","1Thess.4.2","For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus."
"29607","52","4","3","1Thess.4.3","For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:"
"29608","52","4","4","1Thess.4.4","That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;"
"29609","52","4","5","1Thess.4.5","Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:"
"29610","52","4","6","1Thess.4.6","That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified."
"29611","52","4","7","1Thess.4.7","For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness."
"29612","52","4","8","1Thess.4.8","He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit."
"29613","52","4","9","1Thess.4.9","But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another."
"29614","52","4","10","1Thess.4.10","And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;"
"29615","52","4","11","1Thess.4.11","And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;"
"29616","52","4","12","1Thess.4.12","That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing."
"29617","52","4","13","1Thess.4.13","But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope."
"29618","52","4","14","1Thess.4.14","For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him."
"29619","52","4","15","1Thess.4.15","For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep."
"29620","52","4","16","1Thess.4.16","For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:"
"29621","52","4","17","1Thess.4.17","Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."
"29622","52","4","18","1Thess.4.18","Wherefore comfort one another with these words."
"29623","52","5","1","1Thess.5.1","But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you."
"29624","52","5","2","1Thess.5.2","For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night."
"29625","52","5","3","1Thess.5.3","For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape."
"29626","52","5","4","1Thess.5.4","But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."
"29627","52","5","5","1Thess.5.5","Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."
"29628","52","5","6","1Thess.5.6","Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober."
"29629","52","5","7","1Thess.5.7","For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night."
"29630","52","5","8","1Thess.5.8","But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation."
"29631","52","5","9","1Thess.5.9","For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,"
"29632","52","5","10","1Thess.5.10","Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him."
"29633","52","5","11","1Thess.5.11","Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do."
"29634","52","5","12","1Thess.5.12","And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;"
"29635","52","5","13","1Thess.5.13","And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves."
"29636","52","5","14","1Thess.5.14","Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men."
"29637","52","5","15","1Thess.5.15","See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men."
"29638","52","5","16","1Thess.5.16","Rejoice evermore."
"29639","52","5","17","1Thess.5.17","Pray without ceasing."
"29640","52","5","18","1Thess.5.18","In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."
"29641","52","5","19","1Thess.5.19","Quench not the Spirit."
"29642","52","5","20","1Thess.5.20","Despise not prophesyings."
"29643","52","5","21","1Thess.5.21","Prove all things; hold fast that which is good."
"29644","52","5","22","1Thess.5.22","Abstain from all appearance of evil."
"29645","52","5","23","1Thess.5.23","And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
"29646","52","5","24","1Thess.5.24","Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it."
"29647","52","5","25","1Thess.5.25","Brethren, pray for us."
"29648","52","5","26","1Thess.5.26","Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss."
"29649","52","5","27","1Thess.5.27","I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren."
"29650","52","5","28","1Thess.5.28","The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen."
"29651","53","1","1","2Thess.1.1","Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
"29652","53","1","2","2Thess.1.2","Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
"29653","53","1","3","2Thess.1.3","We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;"
"29654","53","1","4","2Thess.1.4","So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:"
"29655","53","1","5","2Thess.1.5","Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:"
"29656","53","1","6","2Thess.1.6","Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;"
"29657","53","1","7","2Thess.1.7","And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,"
"29658","53","1","8","2Thess.1.8","In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
"29659","53","1","9","2Thess.1.9","Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"
"29660","53","1","10","2Thess.1.10","When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day."
"29661","53","1","11","2Thess.1.11","Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:"
"29662","53","1","12","2Thess.1.12","That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
"29663","53","2","1","2Thess.2.1","Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,"
"29664","53","2","2","2Thess.2.2","That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand."
"29665","53","2","3","2Thess.2.3","Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;"
"29666","53","2","4","2Thess.2.4","Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God."
"29667","53","2","5","2Thess.2.5","Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?"
"29668","53","2","6","2Thess.2.6","And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time."
"29669","53","2","7","2Thess.2.7","For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way."
"29670","53","2","8","2Thess.2.8","And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:"
"29671","53","2","9","2Thess.2.9","Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,"
"29672","53","2","10","2Thess.2.10","And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved."
"29673","53","2","11","2Thess.2.11","And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:"
"29674","53","2","12","2Thess.2.12","That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
"29675","53","2","13","2Thess.2.13","But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:"
"29676","53","2","14","2Thess.2.14","Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
"29677","53","2","15","2Thess.2.15","Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle."
"29678","53","2","16","2Thess.2.16","Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,"
"29679","53","2","17","2Thess.2.17","Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work."
"29680","53","3","1","2Thess.3.1","Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:"
"29681","53","3","2","2Thess.3.2","And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith."
"29682","53","3","3","2Thess.3.3","But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil."
"29683","53","3","4","2Thess.3.4","And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you."
"29684","53","3","5","2Thess.3.5","And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ."
"29685","53","3","6","2Thess.3.6","Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us."
"29686","53","3","7","2Thess.3.7","For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;"
"29687","53","3","8","2Thess.3.8","Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:"
"29688","53","3","9","2Thess.3.9","Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us."
"29689","53","3","10","2Thess.3.10","For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."
"29690","53","3","11","2Thess.3.11","For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies."
"29691","53","3","12","2Thess.3.12","Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread."
"29692","53","3","13","2Thess.3.13","But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing."
"29693","53","3","14","2Thess.3.14","And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed."
"29694","53","3","15","2Thess.3.15","Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."
"29695","53","3","16","2Thess.3.16","Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all."
"29696","53","3","17","2Thess.3.17","The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write."
"29697","53","3","18","2Thess.3.18","The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen."
"29698","54","1","1","1Tim.1.1","Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;"
"29699","54","1","2","1Tim.1.2","Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord."
"29700","54","1","3","1Tim.1.3","As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,"
"29701","54","1","4","1Tim.1.4","Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do."
"29702","54","1","5","1Tim.1.5","Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:"
"29703","54","1","6","1Tim.1.6","From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;"
"29704","54","1","7","1Tim.1.7","Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm."
"29705","54","1","8","1Tim.1.8","But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;"
"29706","54","1","9","1Tim.1.9","Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
"29707","54","1","10","1Tim.1.10","For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;"
"29708","54","1","11","1Tim.1.11","According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust."
"29709","54","1","12","1Tim.1.12","And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;"
"29710","54","1","13","1Tim.1.13","Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief."
"29711","54","1","14","1Tim.1.14","And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
"29712","54","1","15","1Tim.1.15","This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief."
"29713","54","1","16","1Tim.1.16","Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting."
"29714","54","1","17","1Tim.1.17","Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen."
"29715","54","1","18","1Tim.1.18","This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;"
"29716","54","1","19","1Tim.1.19","Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:"
"29717","54","1","20","1Tim.1.20","Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."
"29718","54","2","1","1Tim.2.1","I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;"
"29719","54","2","2","1Tim.2.2","For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."
"29720","54","2","3","1Tim.2.3","For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;"
"29721","54","2","4","1Tim.2.4","Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth."
"29722","54","2","5","1Tim.2.5","For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;"
"29723","54","2","6","1Tim.2.6","Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time."
"29724","54","2","7","1Tim.2.7","Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity."
"29725","54","2","8","1Tim.2.8","I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting."
"29726","54","2","9","1Tim.2.9","In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;"
"29727","54","2","10","1Tim.2.10","But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works."
"29728","54","2","11","1Tim.2.11","Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection."
"29729","54","2","12","1Tim.2.12","But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."
"29730","54","2","13","1Tim.2.13","For Adam was first formed, then Eve."
"29731","54","2","14","1Tim.2.14","And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression."
"29732","54","2","15","1Tim.2.15","Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety."
"29733","54","3","1","1Tim.3.1","This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work."
"29734","54","3","2","1Tim.3.2","A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;"
"29735","54","3","3","1Tim.3.3","Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;"
"29736","54","3","4","1Tim.3.4","One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;"
"29737","54","3","5","1Tim.3.5","For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)"
"29738","54","3","6","1Tim.3.6","Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil."
"29739","54","3","7","1Tim.3.7","Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil."
"29740","54","3","8","1Tim.3.8","Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;"
"29741","54","3","9","1Tim.3.9","Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience."
"29742","54","3","10","1Tim.3.10","And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless."
"29743","54","3","11","1Tim.3.11","Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things."
"29744","54","3","12","1Tim.3.12","Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."
"29745","54","3","13","1Tim.3.13","For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus."
"29746","54","3","14","1Tim.3.14","These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:"
"29747","54","3","15","1Tim.3.15","But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
"29748","54","3","16","1Tim.3.16","And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."
"29749","54","4","1","1Tim.4.1","Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;"
"29750","54","4","2","1Tim.4.2","Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;"
"29751","54","4","3","1Tim.4.3","Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth."
"29752","54","4","4","1Tim.4.4","For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:"
"29753","54","4","5","1Tim.4.5","For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer."
"29754","54","4","6","1Tim.4.6","If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained."
"29755","54","4","7","1Tim.4.7","But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness."
"29756","54","4","8","1Tim.4.8","For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."
"29757","54","4","9","1Tim.4.9","This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation."
"29758","54","4","10","1Tim.4.10","For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe."
"29759","54","4","11","1Tim.4.11","These things command and teach."
"29760","54","4","12","1Tim.4.12","Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."
"29761","54","4","13","1Tim.4.13","Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."
"29762","54","4","14","1Tim.4.14","Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery."
"29763","54","4","15","1Tim.4.15","Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all."
"29764","54","4","16","1Tim.4.16","Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee."
"29765","54","5","1","1Tim.5.1","Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;"

"29767","54","5","3","1Tim.5.3","Honour widows that are widows indeed."
"29768","54","5","4","1Tim.5.4","But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God."
"29769","54","5","5","1Tim.5.5","Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day."
"29770","54","5","6","1Tim.5.6","But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth."
"29771","54","5","7","1Tim.5.7","And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless."
"29772","54","5","8","1Tim.5.8","But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel."

"29774","54","5","10","1Tim.5.10","Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work."
"29775","54","5","11","1Tim.5.11","But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;"
"29776","54","5","12","1Tim.5.12","Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith."
"29777","54","5","13","1Tim.5.13","And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not."
"29778","54","5","14","1Tim.5.14","I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully."
"29779","54","5","15","1Tim.5.15","For some are already turned aside after Satan."
"29780","54","5","16","1Tim.5.16","If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed."

"29785","54","5","21","1Tim.5.21","I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality."
"29786","54","5","22","1Tim.5.22","Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure."
"29787","54","5","23","1Tim.5.23","Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities."
"29788","54","5","24","1Tim.5.24","Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after."

"29792","54","6","3","1Tim.6.3","If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;"
"29793","54","6","4","1Tim.6.4","He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,"
"29794","54","6","5","1Tim.6.5","Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself."
"29795","54","6","6","1Tim.6.6","But godliness with contentment is great gain."
"29796","54","6","7","1Tim.6.7","For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out."
"29797","54","6","8","1Tim.6.8","And having food and raiment let us be therewith content."
"29798","54","6","9","1Tim.6.9","But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition."
"29799","54","6","10","1Tim.6.10","For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
"29800","54","6","11","1Tim.6.11","But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness."

"29901","56","1","8","Titus.1.8","But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;"
"29902","56","1","9","Titus.1.9","Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers."
"29903","56","1","10","Titus.1.10","For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:"
"29904","56","1","11","Titus.1.11","Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake."
"29905","56","1","12","Titus.1.12","One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies."
"29906","56","1","13","Titus.1.13","This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;"
"29907","56","1","14","Titus.1.14","Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth."
"29908","56","1","15","Titus.1.15","Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled."
"29909","56","1","16","Titus.1.16","They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate."
"29910","56","2","1","Titus.2.1","But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:"
"29911","56","2","2","Titus.2.2","That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience."
"29912","56","2","3","Titus.2.3","The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;"
"29913","56","2","4","Titus.2.4","That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,"
"29914","56","2","5","Titus.2.5","To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed."
"29915","56","2","6","Titus.2.6","Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded."
"29916","56","2","7","Titus.2.7","In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,"
"29917","56","2","8","Titus.2.8","Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you."
"29918","56","2","9","Titus.2.9","Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;"
"29919","56","2","10","Titus.2.10","Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things."
"29920","56","2","11","Titus.2.11","For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,"
"29921","56","2","12","Titus.2.12","Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;"
"29922","56","2","13","Titus.2.13","Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;"
"29923","56","2","14","Titus.2.14","Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."
"29924","56","2","15","Titus.2.15","These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee."
"29925","56","3","1","Titus.3.1","Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,"
"29926","56","3","2","Titus.3.2","To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men."
"29927","56","3","3","Titus.3.3","For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another."
"29928","56","3","4","Titus.3.4","But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,"
"29929","56","3","5","Titus.3.5","Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;"
"29930","56","3","6","Titus.3.6","Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;"
"29931","56","3","7","Titus.3.7","That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
"29932","56","3","8","Titus.3.8","This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men."
"29933","56","3","9","Titus.3.9","But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain."
"29934","56","3","10","Titus.3.10","A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;"
"29935","56","3","11","Titus.3.11","Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself."
"29936","56","3","12","Titus.3.12","When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter."
"29937","56","3","13","Titus.3.13","Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them."
"29938","56","3","14","Titus.3.14","And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful."
"29939","56","3","15","Titus.3.15","All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen."
"29940","57","1","1","Phlm.1.1","Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,"
"29941","57","1","2","Phlm.1.2","And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:"
"29942","57","1","3","Phlm.1.3","Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
"29943","57","1","4","Phlm.1.4","I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,"
"29944","57","1","5","Phlm.1.5","Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;"
"29945","57","1","6","Phlm.1.6","That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus."
"29946","57","1","7","Phlm.1.7","For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother."
"29947","57","1","8","Phlm.1.8","Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,"
"29948","57","1","9","Phlm.1.9","Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ."
"29949","57","1","10","Phlm.1.10","I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:"
"29950","57","1","11","Phlm.1.11","Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:"
"29951","57","1","12","Phlm.1.12","Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:"
"29952","57","1","13","Phlm.1.13","Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:"
"29953","57","1","14","Phlm.1.14","But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly."
"29954","57","1","15","Phlm.1.15","For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;"
"29955","57","1","16","Phlm.1.16","Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?"
"29956","57","1","17","Phlm.1.17","If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself."
"29957","57","1","18","Phlm.1.18","If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;"
"29958","57","1","19","Phlm.1.19","I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides."
"29959","57","1","20","Phlm.1.20","Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord."
"29960","57","1","21","Phlm.1.21","Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say."
"29961","57","1","22","Phlm.1.22","But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you."
"29962","57","1","23","Phlm.1.23","There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;"
"29963","57","1","24","Phlm.1.24","Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers."
"29964","57","1","25","Phlm.1.25","The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
"29965","58","1","1","Heb.1.1","God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,"
"29966","58","1","2","Heb.1.2","Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;"
"29967","58","1","3","Heb.1.3","Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;"
"29968","58","1","4","Heb.1.4","Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they."
"29969","58","1","5","Heb.1.5","For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"
"29970","58","1","6","Heb.1.6","And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him."
"29971","58","1","7","Heb.1.7","And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire."
"29972","58","1","8","Heb.1.8","But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom."
"29973","58","1","9","Heb.1.9","Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."
"29974","58","1","10","Heb.1.10","And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:"
"29975","58","1","11","Heb.1.11","They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;"
"29976","58","1","12","Heb.1.12","And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail."
"29977","58","1","13","Heb.1.13","But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?"
"29978","58","1","14","Heb.1.14","Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?"
"29979","58","2","1","Heb.2.1","Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip."
"29980","58","2","2","Heb.2.2","For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;"
"29981","58","2","3","Heb.2.3","How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;"
"29982","58","2","4","Heb.2.4","God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?"
"29983","58","2","5","Heb.2.5","For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak."
"29984","58","2","6","Heb.2.6","But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?"
"29985","58","2","7","Heb.2.7","Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:"
"29986","58","2","8","Heb.2.8","Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him."
"29987","58","2","9","Heb.2.9","But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man."
"29988","58","2","10","Heb.2.10","For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
"29989","58","2","11","Heb.2.11","For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,"
"29990","58","2","12","Heb.2.12","Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee."
"29991","58","2","13","Heb.2.13","And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me."
"29992","58","2","14","Heb.2.14","Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;"
"29993","58","2","15","Heb.2.15","And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."
"29994","58","2","16","Heb.2.16","For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham."
"29995","58","2","17","Heb.2.17","Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people."
"29996","58","2","18","Heb.2.18","For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted."
"29997","58","3","1","Heb.3.1","Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;"
"29998","58","3","2","Heb.3.2","Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house."
"29999","58","3","3","Heb.3.3","For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house."
"30000","58","3","4","Heb.3.4","For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God."
"30001","58","3","5","Heb.3.5","And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;"
"30002","58","3","6","Heb.3.6","But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end."
"30003","58","3","7","Heb.3.7","Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,"
"30004","58","3","8","Heb.3.8","Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:"
"30005","58","3","9","Heb.3.9","When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years."
"30006","58","3","10","Heb.3.10","Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways."
"30007","58","3","11","Heb.3.11","So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)"
"30008","58","3","12","Heb.3.12","Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God."
"30009","58","3","13","Heb.3.13","But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."
"30010","58","3","14","Heb.3.14","For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;"
"30011","58","3","15","Heb.3.15","While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation."
"30012","58","3","16","Heb.3.16","For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses."
"30013","58","3","17","Heb.3.17","But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?"
"30014","58","3","18","Heb.3.18","And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?"
"30015","58","3","19","Heb.3.19","So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief."
"30016","58","4","1","Heb.4.1","Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it."
"30017","58","4","2","Heb.4.2","For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it."
"30018","58","4","3","Heb.4.3","For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world."
"30019","58","4","4","Heb.4.4","For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works."
"30020","58","4","5","Heb.4.5","And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest."
"30021","58","4","6","Heb.4.6","Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:"
"30022","58","4","7","Heb.4.7","Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."
"30023","58","4","8","Heb.4.8","For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day."
"30024","58","4","9","Heb.4.9","There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God."
"30025","58","4","10","Heb.4.10","For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his."
"30026","58","4","11","Heb.4.11","Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief."
"30027","58","4","12","Heb.4.12","For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
"30028","58","4","13","Heb.4.13","Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do."
"30029","58","4","14","Heb.4.14","Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession."
"30030","58","4","15","Heb.4.15","For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."
"30031","58","4","16","Heb.4.16","Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."
"30032","58","5","1","Heb.5.1","For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:"
"30033","58","5","2","Heb.5.2","Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity."
"30034","58","5","3","Heb.5.3","And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins."
"30035","58","5","4","Heb.5.4","And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron."
"30036","58","5","5","Heb.5.5","So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee."
"30037","58","5","6","Heb.5.6","As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
"30038","58","5","7","Heb.5.7","Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;"
"30039","58","5","8","Heb.5.8","Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;"
"30040","58","5","9","Heb.5.9","And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;"
"30041","58","5","10","Heb.5.10","Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec."
"30042","58","5","11","Heb.5.11","Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing."
"30043","58","5","12","Heb.5.12","For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat."
"30044","58","5","13","Heb.5.13","For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe."
"30045","58","5","14","Heb.5.14","But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
"30046","58","6","1","Heb.6.1","Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,"
"30047","58","6","2","Heb.6.2","Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."
"30048","58","6","3","Heb.6.3","And this will we do, if God permit."
"30049","58","6","4","Heb.6.4","For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,"
"30050","58","6","5","Heb.6.5","And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,"
"30051","58","6","6","Heb.6.6","If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame."
"30052","58","6","7","Heb.6.7","For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:"
"30053","58","6","8","Heb.6.8","But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned."
"30054","58","6","9","Heb.6.9","But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak."
"30055","58","6","10","Heb.6.10","For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister."
"30056","58","6","11","Heb.6.11","And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:"
"30057","58","6","12","Heb.6.12","That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
"30058","58","6","13","Heb.6.13","For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,"
"30059","58","6","14","Heb.6.14","Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee."
"30060","58","6","15","Heb.6.15","And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise."
"30061","58","6","16","Heb.6.16","For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife."
"30062","58","6","17","Heb.6.17","Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:"
"30063","58","6","18","Heb.6.18","That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:"
"30064","58","6","19","Heb.6.19","Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;"
"30065","58","6","20","Heb.6.20","Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
"30066","58","7","1","Heb.7.1","For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;"
"30067","58","7","2","Heb.7.2","To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;"
"30068","58","7","3","Heb.7.3","Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually."
"30069","58","7","4","Heb.7.4","Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils."
"30070","58","7","5","Heb.7.5","And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:"
"30071","58","7","6","Heb.7.6","But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises."
"30072","58","7","7","Heb.7.7","And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better."
"30073","58","7","8","Heb.7.8","And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth."
"30074","58","7","9","Heb.7.9","And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham."
"30075","58","7","10","Heb.7.10","For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him."
"30076","58","7","11","Heb.7.11","If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?"
"30077","58","7","12","Heb.7.12","For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law."
"30078","58","7","13","Heb.7.13","For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar."
"30079","58","7","14","Heb.7.14","For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood."
"30080","58","7","15","Heb.7.15","And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,"
"30081","58","7","16","Heb.7.16","Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life."
"30082","58","7","17","Heb.7.17","For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
"30083","58","7","18","Heb.7.18","For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof."
"30084","58","7","19","Heb.7.19","For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God."
"30085","58","7","20","Heb.7.20","And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:"
"30086","58","7","21","Heb.7.21","For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)"
"30087","58","7","22","Heb.7.22","By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament."
"30088","58","7","23","Heb.7.23","And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:"
"30089","58","7","24","Heb.7.24","But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood."
"30090","58","7","25","Heb.7.25","Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."
"30091","58","7","26","Heb.7.26","For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;"
"30092","58","7","27","Heb.7.27","Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself."
"30093","58","7","28","Heb.7.28","For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore."
"30094","58","8","1","Heb.8.1","Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;"
"30095","58","8","2","Heb.8.2","A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man."
"30096","58","8","3","Heb.8.3","For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer."
"30097","58","8","4","Heb.8.4","For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:"
"30098","58","8","5","Heb.8.5","Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount."
"30099","58","8","6","Heb.8.6","But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises."
"30100","58","8","7","Heb.8.7","For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second."
"30101","58","8","8","Heb.8.8","For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:"
"30102","58","8","9","Heb.8.9","Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord."
"30103","58","8","10","Heb.8.10","For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:"
"30104","58","8","11","Heb.8.11","And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest."
"30105","58","8","12","Heb.8.12","For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."
"30106","58","8","13","Heb.8.13","In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away."
"30107","58","9","1","Heb.9.1","Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary."
"30108","58","9","2","Heb.9.2","For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary."
"30109","58","9","3","Heb.9.3","And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;"
"30110","58","9","4","Heb.9.4","Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;"
"30111","58","9","5","Heb.9.5","And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly."
"30112","58","9","6","Heb.9.6","Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God."
"30113","58","9","7","Heb.9.7","But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:"
"30114","58","9","8","Heb.9.8","The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:"
"30115","58","9","9","Heb.9.9","Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;"
"30116","58","9","10","Heb.9.10","Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation."
"30117","58","9","11","Heb.9.11","But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;"
"30118","58","9","12","Heb.9.12","Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us."
"30119","58","9","13","Heb.9.13","For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:"
"30120","58","9","14","Heb.9.14","How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
"30121","58","9","15","Heb.9.15","And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."
"30122","58","9","16","Heb.9.16","For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator."
"30123","58","9","17","Heb.9.17","For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth."
"30124","58","9","18","Heb.9.18","Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood."
"30125","58","9","19","Heb.9.19","For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,"
"30126","58","9","20","Heb.9.20","Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you."
"30127","58","9","21","Heb.9.21","Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry."
"30128","58","9","22","Heb.9.22","And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission."
"30129","58","9","23","Heb.9.23","It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
"30130","58","9","24","Heb.9.24","For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:"
"30131","58","9","25","Heb.9.25","Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;"
"30132","58","9","26","Heb.9.26","For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself."
"30133","58","9","27","Heb.9.27","And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:"
"30134","58","9","28","Heb.9.28","So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation."
"30135","58","10","1","Heb.10.1","For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect."
"30136","58","10","2","Heb.10.2","For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins."
"30137","58","10","3","Heb.10.3","But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year."
"30138","58","10","4","Heb.10.4","For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins."
"30139","58","10","5","Heb.10.5","Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:"
"30140","58","10","6","Heb.10.6","In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure."
"30141","58","10","7","Heb.10.7","Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God."
"30142","58","10","8","Heb.10.8","Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;"
"30143","58","10","9","Heb.10.9","Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second."
"30144","58","10","10","Heb.10.10","By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."
"30145","58","10","11","Heb.10.11","And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:"
"30146","58","10","12","Heb.10.12","But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;"
"30147","58","10","13","Heb.10.13","From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool."
"30148","58","10","14","Heb.10.14","For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified."
"30149","58","10","15","Heb.10.15","Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,"
"30150","58","10","16","Heb.10.16","This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;"
"30151","58","10","17","Heb.10.17","And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more."
"30152","58","10","18","Heb.10.18","Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin."
"30153","58","10","19","Heb.10.19","Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,"
"30154","58","10","20","Heb.10.20","By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;"
"30155","58","10","21","Heb.10.21","And having an high priest over the house of God;"
"30156","58","10","22","Heb.10.22","Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water."
"30157","58","10","23","Heb.10.23","Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)"
"30158","58","10","24","Heb.10.24","And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:"
"30159","58","10","25","Heb.10.25","Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching."
"30160","58","10","26","Heb.10.26","For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,"
"30161","58","10","27","Heb.10.27","But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."
"30162","58","10","28","Heb.10.28","He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:"
"30163","58","10","29","Heb.10.29","Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?"
"30164","58","10","30","Heb.10.30","For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people."
"30165","58","10","31","Heb.10.31","It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
"30166","58","10","32","Heb.10.32","But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;"
"30167","58","10","33","Heb.10.33","Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used."
"30168","58","10","34","Heb.10.34","For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance."
"30169","58","10","35","Heb.10.35","Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward."
"30170","58","10","36","Heb.10.36","For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise."
"30171","58","10","37","Heb.10.37","For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry."
"30172","58","10","38","Heb.10.38","Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."
"30173","58","10","39","Heb.10.39","But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul."
"30174","58","11","1","Heb.11.1","Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
"30175","58","11","2","Heb.11.2","For by it the elders obtained a good report."
"30176","58","11","3","Heb.11.3","Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."
"30177","58","11","4","Heb.11.4","By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh."
"30178","58","11","5","Heb.11.5","By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God."
"30179","58","11","6","Heb.11.6","But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."
"30180","58","11","7","Heb.11.7","By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith."
"30181","58","11","8","Heb.11.8","By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went."
"30182","58","11","9","Heb.11.9","By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:"
"30183","58","11","10","Heb.11.10","For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God."
"30184","58","11","11","Heb.11.11","Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised."
"30185","58","11","12","Heb.11.12","Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable."
"30186","58","11","13","Heb.11.13","These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth."
"30187","58","11","14","Heb.11.14","For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country."
"30188","58","11","15","Heb.11.15","And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned."
"30189","58","11","16","Heb.11.16","But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city."
"30190","58","11","17","Heb.11.17","By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,"
"30191","58","11","18","Heb.11.18","Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:"
"30192","58","11","19","Heb.11.19","Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure."
"30193","58","11","20","Heb.11.20","By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come."
"30194","58","11","21","Heb.11.21","By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff."
"30195","58","11","22","Heb.11.22","By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones."
"30196","58","11","23","Heb.11.23","By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment."
"30197","58","11","24","Heb.11.24","By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;"
"30198","58","11","25","Heb.11.25","Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;"
"30199","58","11","26","Heb.11.26","Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward."
"30200","58","11","27","Heb.11.27","By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible."
"30201","58","11","28","Heb.11.28","Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them."
"30202","58","11","29","Heb.11.29","By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned."
"30203","58","11","30","Heb.11.30","By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days."
"30204","58","11","31","Heb.11.31","By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace."
"30205","58","11","32","Heb.11.32","And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:"
"30206","58","11","33","Heb.11.33","Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,"
"30207","58","11","34","Heb.11.34","Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens."
"30208","58","11","35","Heb.11.35","Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:"
"30209","58","11","36","Heb.11.36","And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:"
"30210","58","11","37","Heb.11.37","They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;"
"30211","58","11","38","Heb.11.38","Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth."
"30212","58","11","39","Heb.11.39","And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:"
"30213","58","11","40","Heb.11.40","God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."
"30214","58","12","1","Heb.12.1","Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,"
"30215","58","12","2","Heb.12.2","Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."
"30216","58","12","3","Heb.12.3","For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds."
"30217","58","12","4","Heb.12.4","Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin."
"30218","58","12","5","Heb.12.5","And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:"
"30219","58","12","6","Heb.12.6","For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."
"30220","58","12","7","Heb.12.7","If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?"
"30221","58","12","8","Heb.12.8","But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons."
"30222","58","12","9","Heb.12.9","Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?"
"30223","58","12","10","Heb.12.10","For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness."
"30224","58","12","11","Heb.12.11","Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby."
"30225","58","12","12","Heb.12.12","Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;"
"30226","58","12","13","Heb.12.13","And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed."
"30227","58","12","14","Heb.12.14","Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:"
"30228","58","12","15","Heb.12.15","Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;"
"30229","58","12","16","Heb.12.16","Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright."
"30230","58","12","17","Heb.12.17","For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears."
"30231","58","12","18","Heb.12.18","For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,"
"30232","58","12","19","Heb.12.19","And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:"
"30233","58","12","20","Heb.12.20","For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:"
"30234","58","12","21","Heb.12.21","And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)"
"30235","58","12","22","Heb.12.22","But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,"
"30236","58","12","23","Heb.12.23","To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,"
"30237","58","12","24","Heb.12.24","And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel."
"30238","58","12","25","Heb.12.25","See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:"
"30239","58","12","26","Heb.12.26","Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven."
"30240","58","12","27","Heb.12.27","And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain."
"30241","58","12","28","Heb.12.28","Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:"
"30242","58","12","29","Heb.12.29","For our God is a consuming fire."
"30243","58","13","1","Heb.13.1","Let brotherly love continue."
"30244","58","13","2","Heb.13.2","Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares."
"30245","58","13","3","Heb.13.3","Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body."
"30246","58","13","4","Heb.13.4","Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge."

"30248","58","13","6","Heb.13.6","So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me."

"30251","58","13","9","Heb.13.9","Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein."
"30252","58","13","10","Heb.13.10","We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle."
"30253","58","13","11","Heb.13.11","For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp."
"30254","58","13","12","Heb.13.12","Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate."

"30270","59","1","3","Jas.1.3","Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience."
"30271","59","1","4","Jas.1.4","But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing."
"30272","59","1","5","Jas.1.5","If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."
"30273","59","1","6","Jas.1.6","But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed."
"30274","59","1","7","Jas.1.7","For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord."
"30275","59","1","8","Jas.1.8","A double minded man is unstable in all his ways."
"30276","59","1","9","Jas.1.9","Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:"
"30277","59","1","10","Jas.1.10","But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away."
"30278","59","1","11","Jas.1.11","For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways."
"30279","59","1","12","Jas.1.12","Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him."
"30280","59","1","13","Jas.1.13","Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:"
"30281","59","1","14","Jas.1.14","But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed."
"30282","59","1","15","Jas.1.15","Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death."
"30283","59","1","16","Jas.1.16","Do not err, my beloved brethren."
"30284","59","1","17","Jas.1.17","Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."
"30285","59","1","18","Jas.1.18","Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures."
"30286","59","1","19","Jas.1.19","Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:"
"30287","59","1","20","Jas.1.20","For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God."
"30288","59","1","21","Jas.1.21","Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls."
"30289","59","1","22","Jas.1.22","But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves."
"30290","59","1","23","Jas.1.23","For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:"
"30291","59","1","24","Jas.1.24","For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was."
"30292","59","1","25","Jas.1.25","But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."
"30293","59","1","26","Jas.1.26","If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain."
"30294","59","1","27","Jas.1.27","Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."
"30295","59","2","1","Jas.2.1","My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons."
"30296","59","2","2","Jas.2.2","For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;"
"30297","59","2","3","Jas.2.3","And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:"
"30298","59","2","4","Jas.2.4","Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?"
"30299","59","2","5","Jas.2.5","Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?"
"30300","59","2","6","Jas.2.6","But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?"
"30301","59","2","7","Jas.2.7","Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?"
"30302","59","2","8","Jas.2.8","If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:"
"30303","59","2","9","Jas.2.9","But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors."
"30304","59","2","10","Jas.2.10","For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."
"30305","59","2","11","Jas.2.11","For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law."
"30306","59","2","12","Jas.2.12","So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."
"30307","59","2","13","Jas.2.13","For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment."
"30308","59","2","14","Jas.2.14","What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?"
"30309","59","2","15","Jas.2.15","If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,"
"30310","59","2","16","Jas.2.16","And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?"
"30311","59","2","17","Jas.2.17","Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone."
"30312","59","2","18","Jas.2.18","Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works."
"30313","59","2","19","Jas.2.19","Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble."
"30314","59","2","20","Jas.2.20","But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"
"30315","59","2","21","Jas.2.21","Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?"
"30316","59","2","22","Jas.2.22","Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?"
"30317","59","2","23","Jas.2.23","And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God."
"30318","59","2","24","Jas.2.24","Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only."
"30319","59","2","25","Jas.2.25","Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?"
"30320","59","2","26","Jas.2.26","For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
"30321","59","3","1","Jas.3.1","My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation."
"30322","59","3","2","Jas.3.2","For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body."
"30323","59","3","3","Jas.3.3","Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body."
"30324","59","3","4","Jas.3.4","Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth."
"30325","59","3","5","Jas.3.5","Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!"
"30326","59","3","6","Jas.3.6","And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell."
"30327","59","3","7","Jas.3.7","For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:"
"30328","59","3","8","Jas.3.8","But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison."
"30329","59","3","9","Jas.3.9","Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God."
"30330","59","3","10","Jas.3.10","Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be."
"30331","59","3","11","Jas.3.11","Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?"
"30332","59","3","12","Jas.3.12","Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh."
"30333","59","3","13","Jas.3.13","Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom."
"30334","59","3","14","Jas.3.14","But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth."
"30335","59","3","15","Jas.3.15","This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish."
"30336","59","3","16","Jas.3.16","For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work."
"30337","59","3","17","Jas.3.17","But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy."
"30338","59","3","18","Jas.3.18","And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace."
"30339","59","4","1","Jas.4.1","From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?"
"30340","59","4","2","Jas.4.2","Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not."
"30341","59","4","3","Jas.4.3","Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts."
"30342","59","4","4","Jas.4.4","Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God."
"30343","59","4","5","Jas.4.5","Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?"
"30344","59","4","6","Jas.4.6","But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble."
"30345","59","4","7","Jas.4.7","Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
"30346","59","4","8","Jas.4.8","Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded."
"30347","59","4","9","Jas.4.9","Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness."
"30348","59","4","10","Jas.4.10","Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up."
"30349","59","4","11","Jas.4.11","Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge."
"30350","59","4","12","Jas.4.12","There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?"
"30351","59","4","13","Jas.4.13","Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:"
"30352","59","4","14","Jas.4.14","Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away."
"30353","59","4","15","Jas.4.15","For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that."
"30354","59","4","16","Jas.4.16","But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil."
"30355","59","4","17","Jas.4.17","Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin."
"30356","59","5","1","Jas.5.1","Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you."
"30357","59","5","2","Jas.5.2","Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten."
"30358","59","5","3","Jas.5.3","Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days."
"30359","59","5","4","Jas.5.4","Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth."
"30360","59","5","5","Jas.5.5","Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter."
"30361","59","5","6","Jas.5.6","Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you."
"30362","59","5","7","Jas.5.7","Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain."
"30363","59","5","8","Jas.5.8","Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh."
"30364","59","5","9","Jas.5.9","Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door."
"30365","59","5","10","Jas.5.10","Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience."
"30366","59","5","11","Jas.5.11","Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy."
"30367","59","5","12","Jas.5.12","But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation."
"30368","59","5","13","Jas.5.13","Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms."
"30369","59","5","14","Jas.5.14","Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:"
"30370","59","5","15","Jas.5.15","And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."
"30371","59","5","16","Jas.5.16","Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much."
"30372","59","5","17","Jas.5.17","Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months."
"30373","59","5","18","Jas.5.18","And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit."
"30374","59","5","19","Jas.5.19","Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;"
"30375","59","5","20","Jas.5.20","Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins."
"30376","60","1","1","1Pet.1.1","Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
"30377","60","1","2","1Pet.1.2","Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied."
"30378","60","1","3","1Pet.1.3","Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"
"30379","60","1","4","1Pet.1.4","To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,"
"30380","60","1","5","1Pet.1.5","Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."
"30381","60","1","6","1Pet.1.6","Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:"
"30382","60","1","7","1Pet.1.7","That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:"
"30383","60","1","8","1Pet.1.8","Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:"
"30384","60","1","9","1Pet.1.9","Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."
"30385","60","1","10","1Pet.1.10","Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:"
"30386","60","1","11","1Pet.1.11","Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow."
"30387","60","1","12","1Pet.1.12","Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into."
"30388","60","1","13","1Pet.1.13","Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;"
"30389","60","1","14","1Pet.1.14","As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:"
"30390","60","1","15","1Pet.1.15","But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;"
"30391","60","1","16","1Pet.1.16","Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy."
"30392","60","1","17","1Pet.1.17","And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:"
"30393","60","1","18","1Pet.1.18","Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;"
"30394","60","1","19","1Pet.1.19","But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:"
"30395","60","1","20","1Pet.1.20","Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,"
"30396","60","1","21","1Pet.1.21","Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God."
"30397","60","1","22","1Pet.1.22","Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:"
"30398","60","1","23","1Pet.1.23","Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever."
"30399","60","1","24","1Pet.1.24","For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:"
"30400","60","1","25","1Pet.1.25","But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you."
"30401","60","2","1","1Pet.2.1","Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,"
"30402","60","2","2","1Pet.2.2","As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:"
"30403","60","2","3","1Pet.2.3","If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious."
"30404","60","2","4","1Pet.2.4","To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,"
"30405","60","2","5","1Pet.2.5","Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ."
"30406","60","2","6","1Pet.2.6","Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded."
"30407","60","2","7","1Pet.2.7","Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,"
"30408","60","2","8","1Pet.2.8","And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed."
"30409","60","2","9","1Pet.2.9","But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:"
"30410","60","2","10","1Pet.2.10","Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy."
"30411","60","2","11","1Pet.2.11","Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;"
"30412","60","2","12","1Pet.2.12","Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation."
"30413","60","2","13","1Pet.2.13","Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;"
"30414","60","2","14","1Pet.2.14","Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well."
"30415","60","2","15","1Pet.2.15","For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:"
"30416","60","2","16","1Pet.2.16","As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God."
"30417","60","2","17","1Pet.2.17","Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king."
"30418","60","2","18","1Pet.2.18","Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward."
"30419","60","2","19","1Pet.2.19","For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully."
"30420","60","2","20","1Pet.2.20","For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God."
"30421","60","2","21","1Pet.2.21","For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:"
"30422","60","2","22","1Pet.2.22","Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:"
"30423","60","2","23","1Pet.2.23","Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:"
"30424","60","2","24","1Pet.2.24","Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed."
"30425","60","2","25","1Pet.2.25","For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls."
"30426","60","3","1","1Pet.3.1","Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;"
"30427","60","3","2","1Pet.3.2","While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear."
"30428","60","3","3","1Pet.3.3","Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;"
"30429","60","3","4","1Pet.3.4","But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price."
"30430","60","3","5","1Pet.3.5","For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:"
"30431","60","3","6","1Pet.3.6","Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement."
"30432","60","3","7","1Pet.3.7","Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered."
"30433","60","3","8","1Pet.3.8","Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:"
"30434","60","3","9","1Pet.3.9","Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing."
"30435","60","3","10","1Pet.3.10","For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:"
"30436","60","3","11","1Pet.3.11","Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it."
"30437","60","3","12","1Pet.3.12","For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil."
"30438","60","3","13","1Pet.3.13","And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?"
"30439","60","3","14","1Pet.3.14","But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;"
"30440","60","3","15","1Pet.3.15","But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:"
"30441","60","3","16","1Pet.3.16","Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ."
"30442","60","3","17","1Pet.3.17","For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing."
"30443","60","3","18","1Pet.3.18","For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:"
"30444","60","3","19","1Pet.3.19","By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;"
"30445","60","3","20","1Pet.3.20","Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water."
"30446","60","3","21","1Pet.3.21","The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:"
"30447","60","3","22","1Pet.3.22","Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him."
"30448","60","4","1","1Pet.4.1","Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;"
"30449","60","4","2","1Pet.4.2","That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God."
"30450","60","4","3","1Pet.4.3","For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:"
"30451","60","4","4","1Pet.4.4","Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:"
"30452","60","4","5","1Pet.4.5","Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead."
"30453","60","4","6","1Pet.4.6","For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."
"30454","60","4","7","1Pet.4.7","But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer."
"30455","60","4","8","1Pet.4.8","And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins."
"30456","60","4","9","1Pet.4.9","Use hospitality one to another without grudging."
"30457","60","4","10","1Pet.4.10","As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."
"30458","60","4","11","1Pet.4.11","If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."
"30459","60","4","12","1Pet.4.12","Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:"
"30460","60","4","13","1Pet.4.13","But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy."
"30461","60","4","14","1Pet.4.14","If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified."
"30462","60","4","15","1Pet.4.15","But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters."
"30463","60","4","16","1Pet.4.16","Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf."
"30464","60","4","17","1Pet.4.17","For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?"
"30465","60","4","18","1Pet.4.18","And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?"
"30466","60","4","19","1Pet.4.19","Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator."
"30467","60","5","1","1Pet.5.1","The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:"
"30468","60","5","2","1Pet.5.2","Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;"
"30469","60","5","3","1Pet.5.3","Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock."
"30470","60","5","4","1Pet.5.4","And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away."
"30471","60","5","5","1Pet.5.5","Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble."
"30472","60","5","6","1Pet.5.6","Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:"
"30473","60","5","7","1Pet.5.7","Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you."
"30474","60","5","8","1Pet.5.8","Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:"
"30475","60","5","9","1Pet.5.9","Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world."
"30476","60","5","10","1Pet.5.10","But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you."
"30477","60","5","11","1Pet.5.11","To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."
"30478","60","5","12","1Pet.5.12","By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand."
"30479","60","5","13","1Pet.5.13","The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son."
"30480","60","5","14","1Pet.5.14","Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen."
"30481","61","1","1","2Pet.1.1","Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:"
"30482","61","1","2","2Pet.1.2","Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,"
"30483","61","1","3","2Pet.1.3","According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:"
"30484","61","1","4","2Pet.1.4","Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
"30485","61","1","5","2Pet.1.5","And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;"
"30486","61","1","6","2Pet.1.6","And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;"
"30487","61","1","7","2Pet.1.7","And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity."
"30488","61","1","8","2Pet.1.8","For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
"30489","61","1","9","2Pet.1.9","But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins."
"30490","61","1","10","2Pet.1.10","Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:"
"30491","61","1","11","2Pet.1.11","For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
"30492","61","1","12","2Pet.1.12","Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth."
"30493","61","1","13","2Pet.1.13","Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;"
"30494","61","1","14","2Pet.1.14","Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me."
"30495","61","1","15","2Pet.1.15","Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance."
"30496","61","1","16","2Pet.1.16","For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
"30497","61","1","17","2Pet.1.17","For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
"30498","61","1","18","2Pet.1.18","And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount."
"30499","61","1","19","2Pet.1.19","We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:"
"30500","61","1","20","2Pet.1.20","Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation."
"30501","61","1","21","2Pet.1.21","For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."
"30502","61","2","1","2Pet.2.1","But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction."
"30503","61","2","2","2Pet.2.2","And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of."
"30504","61","2","3","2Pet.2.3","And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not."
"30505","61","2","4","2Pet.2.4","For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;"
"30506","61","2","5","2Pet.2.5","And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;"
"30507","61","2","6","2Pet.2.6","And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;"
"30508","61","2","7","2Pet.2.7","And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:"
"30509","61","2","8","2Pet.2.8","For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)"
"30510","61","2","9","2Pet.2.9","The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:"
"30511","61","2","10","2Pet.2.10","But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities."
"30512","61","2","11","2Pet.2.11","Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord."
"30513","61","2","12","2Pet.2.12","But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;"
"30514","61","2","13","2Pet.2.13","And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;"
"30515","61","2","14","2Pet.2.14","Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:"
"30516","61","2","15","2Pet.2.15","Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;"
"30517","61","2","16","2Pet.2.16","But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet."
"30518","61","2","17","2Pet.2.17","These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever."
"30519","61","2","18","2Pet.2.18","For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error."
"30520","61","2","19","2Pet.2.19","While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage."
"30521","61","2","20","2Pet.2.20","For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning."
"30522","61","2","21","2Pet.2.21","For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them."
"30523","61","2","22","2Pet.2.22","But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."
"30524","61","3","1","2Pet.3.1","This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:"
"30525","61","3","2","2Pet.3.2","That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:"
"30526","61","3","3","2Pet.3.3","Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,"
"30527","61","3","4","2Pet.3.4","And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."
"30528","61","3","5","2Pet.3.5","For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:"
"30529","61","3","6","2Pet.3.6","Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:"
"30530","61","3","7","2Pet.3.7","But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men."
"30531","61","3","8","2Pet.3.8","But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."
"30532","61","3","9","2Pet.3.9","The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
"30533","61","3","10","2Pet.3.10","But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up."
"30534","61","3","11","2Pet.3.11","Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,"
"30535","61","3","12","2Pet.3.12","Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?"
"30536","61","3","13","2Pet.3.13","Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."
"30537","61","3","14","2Pet.3.14","Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless."
"30538","61","3","15","2Pet.3.15","And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;"
"30539","61","3","16","2Pet.3.16","As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction."
"30540","61","3","17","2Pet.3.17","Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness."
"30541","61","3","18","2Pet.3.18","But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen."
"30542","62","1","1","1John.1.1","That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;"
